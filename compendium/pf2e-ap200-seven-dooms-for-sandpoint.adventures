Encounters with locals and locations key to this\n  adventure’s plot are presented as needed, and an expanded look at the doomed town of Sandpoint appears near the end of\n  this book, but that section only provides brief descriptions for the locations and people of the town. If you want to\n  breathe more life into Sandpoint, look no further than\n  <em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Published in 2018, <em>Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast</em> presents a detailed, 96-page look at the town of\n  Sandpoint and its hinterlands. While published for Pathfinder First Edition rules, much of this book’s information\n  remains edition-neutral and can be of great use for GMs who seek to expand their Sandpoint campaign, particularly for\n  those whose players can’t get enough of the town and want to explore all of its secrets. Keep in mind that the\n  resource presents Sandpoint as it was in the years immediately following Karzoug’s rise but before local barkeep\n  Ameiko Kaijitsu—yet to discover her true name of Amatatsu—left town to seek her destiny in Minkai.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Much of the plot for this adventure comes from story hooks and details presented in this earlier book, so players\n  familiar with its contents may be aware of some of the surprises and plot twists in store for them in “Seven Dooms for\n  Sandpoint.” You may wish to remind these players of the value of keeping a barrier between their character’s knowledge\n  and their own knowledge of the region. At the same time, some of the details presented in Sandpoint, Light of the Lost\n  Coast have been altered and changed in this adventure to serve the needs of the plot.\n</p>"

Conceived eons before by his demonic parents,\n  @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.aipkJQxP4GBsTaGq]{Lamashtu} and\n  @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.IZcdF1G8ZsnMotaM]{Pazuzu}, Uvaglor lay dormant, slowly\n  gestating at the base of a deep hole in the ground. When Thassilon rose in power, a wizard named Liralarue came to\n  this site and, intrigued by the latent power in the area, built a series of underground chambers surrounding the\n  shaft.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Yet Liralarue never fully discovered the true nature of the strange Abyssal power at the bottom of this “pit,” as her\n  studies came to an abrupt end with Earthfall. For decades, the world lay in ruins, and the violence of Earthfall did\n  what a Thassilonian wizard could not—it quickened the nascent demon’s gestation within the stone below and slowly\n  roused him from slumber. The three-eyed fiend emerged from his birthplace into a ruined world, and the site of his\n  emergence would become known, in time, as the Pit.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For years, Uvaglor brutalized the Varisians who dwelled along the Lost Coast, until a priest named Sazzleru banished\n  him into a prison in the Maelstrom. His one-time lair remained a blight on the Lost Coast, so Sazzleru worked great\n  magic to weave a ward into the Pit to contain its Abyssal infection, taking extra care to ensure that none who served\n  the Abyss could ever undo her work.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Knowledge of the Pit’s genesis faded from memory until a mothman priest of Pazuzu known as the\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20012advent.JournalEntryPage.12theredbishop00]{The Red Bishop} discovered\n  this legacy. Inspired by the Worldwound, the\n  Red Bishop had visions of creating a similar devastation in Varisia, but\n  after his initial investigations resulted in a painful lesson about the power that remained in Sazzleru’s magic, he\n  did what mothmen do best—plan, prepare, and enable a burgeoning disaster.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Red Bishop was pleased at\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11adoomedtown000#sandpointsettlement-4]{Sandpoint's} location\n  within this new territory, patiently enacting his plans to lure\n  Uvaglor back to the Lost Coast. The Red Bishop knew that Uvaglor’s return would surely shatter the Pit and transform\n  it into a rent between Golarion and the Abyss, but not as long as Sazzleru’s ward remained.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The answer lay in one of mortalkind’s most iconic pursuits—adventuring. By manipulating regional events and\n  manipulating visionaries and outcasts such as the eccentric artist Jervis Stoot, the Red Bishop cultivated a culture\n  and need for adventurers. By letting the locals’ need for adventure foster itself, he ensured that the resulting\n  adventurers would not be “agents of the Abyss” and, thus, could potentially undo the magic of Sazzleru’s ward. Once a\n  group was sufficiently powerful and could be tricked into the Pit to unknowingly remove the ancient wards, the Red\n  Bishop could trigger the final stage of his plan—the incineration of Sandpoint through a devastating fire lit by an\n  ancient remnant of old Thassilon, the Hellstorm Flume. The Red Bishop’s visions left him convinced that such a\n  sacrifice in Uvaglor’s name would draw the demon’s attention back to the Lost Coast, and that his return would tear\n  the Pit open.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Red Bishop nearly achieved success years ago when one promising group came to Sandpoint’s aid, but the rising of\n  Runelord Karzoug diverted their attention away from the region before the Red Bishop could coax them toward the Pit.\n  He’s learned from that mistake, and now seeks to even more subtly manipulate events to drive a fresh group of heroes\n  into the Pit to accidently undo Sazzleru’s work.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And so, as the Red Bishop’s plans come to a head, seven separate dooms, each with ties to the Pit and links to\n  long-laid plots set in motion by the Red Bishop himself will soon strike the Lost Coast and the town of Sandpoint...\n  unless the PCs can stop them!\n</p>"

When the PCs arrive, they’re met by an acolyte who leads them through the cathedral to the interior\n  veranda where lunch and Abstalar await. The veranda looks out to the south over the cathedral’s grassy central\n  courtyard, wherein a set of seven 9-foot-tall menhirs loom around a circular altar stone. Abstalar greets the PCs with\n  a smile and open arms, then invites them to be seated at the table and enjoy the fine weather and food with him. He\n  waves aside questions about why he’s called the PCs here for the moment, saying “Let’s eat and enjoy the day for a bit\n  before turning to that.” Use this lunch as a chance for each of the PCs to introduce themselves. Abstalar certainly\n  knows a bit about any previous adventures the PCs were on—their success at those endeavors being a big reason why he’s\n  calling on them now—but is eager to learn a bit more. Give each player a chance to talk about their character’s\n  history before proceeding.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once the PCs are done with lunch, Abstalar gives a heavy sigh and gathers his thoughts for a moment before asking what\n  the PCs know about Sandpoint’s shameful history. While the scandal involving Sandpoint’s founding several decades ago\n  certainly didn’t start things off on the best foot, what Abstalar is more concerned with is how the town and his\n  predecessor, Ezakien Tobyn, treated the foundling aasimar Nualia. Abstalar can fill the PCs in on the whole story (as\n  presented under @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11adoomedtown000]{A Doomed Town}) if necessary.\n  After he’s satisfied the PCs are up to speed on the events\n  that led to Nualia’s death, he proceeds as follows.\n</p>\n<div class=\"read-aloud\">\n  <p>\n    “And that brings us to today. Over the past seventeen years, I’ve done much thinking on poor Nualia, as she didn’t\n    deserve the fate she got. I’m certainly not justifying her actions, but I wish it never came to that sort of\n    situation in the first place. That I only came to town after the fire that took my predecessor’s life is no\n    excuse—all of those who worship Desna should know better and treat the children of the world more kindly. My\n    predecessor’s failure to be a father figure is in part what caused Nualia’s fall, but the people of Sandpoint were\n    no help in how they treated her as something less than human—something fit only to soften their own fears, or\n    something to jealously covet.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    “After her defeat, the least I could do was see to it that she got a proper burial here in town. Some folks blanched\n    at the idea, but I’m glad that most of us were more understanding and forgiving. Only, I feel like it’s not enough.\n    Nualia needs to know we’ve forgiven her... she needs to know that I have forgiven her. She doesn’t deserve an\n    afterlife of torment—her life was torment enough.”\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  Abstalar pauses here to gauge the PCs’ reaction to his concerns and observations. He hasn’t broached this topic with\n  anyone yet other than his friend Audrahni, and is interested in seeing how the PCs react. He hopes they’re\n  compassionate and understanding, but even if they’re not, he soon continues.\n</p>\n<div class=\"read-aloud\">\n  <p>\n    “I’ve only spoken of this with one other—a friend named Audrahni. Nualia’s been dead for nearly two decades, but\n    time does not pass the same for the dead as it does for the living. Audrahni knows a ritual that can put us in\n    contact with the spirits of the dead and, in her latest letter, she told me she’s willing to perform this ritual\n    here when next she visits, so that I can offer Nualia my apologies and forgive her. I don’t know if that will be\n    enough to help her, or to stave off an afterlife of torment, but I do know that if nothing is done, Sandpoint will\n    have failed her yet again.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    “Here’s where the complication comes in. In order for Audrahni’s ritual to succeed, we need a physical link to\n    Nualia’s soul. It’s been years, and any of her belongings are long gone now, which leaves only her mortal remains.\n    As loath as I was to exhume her body, it was necessary to the ritual, to giving her my forgiveness. But when we\n    opened her grave, we made an awful discovery. Her coffin was empty—tunneled into from below, so that when we reached\n    it, the whole grave caved in. Naffer and I were fortunate enough to escape without much harm, but now there’s a hole\n    where her grave used to be—a hole that leads to an underground tunnel below the boneyard.”\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  Abstalar pauses to allow the PCs to ask questions. Likely questions and his answers are given below; the most\n  important thing to convey to the PCs here is his suspicion that ghouls now infest the boneyard, so if they don’t ask\n  those questions, Abstalar volunteers that information.\n</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar float-right\">\n  <h1>Audrahni</h1>\n  <p>\n    The elven cleric Audrahni previously appeared in the first adventure of the Return of the Runelords Adventure Path,\n    “Secrets of Roderic’s Cove.” This adventure assumes some time has passed since then, and that she’s gained a few\n    levels. If you and your group played Return of the Runelords and Audrahni ended that campaign at a much higher level\n    or perished, feel free to replace her with a cleric of your own design. No stats are provided for Audrahni, since\n    she won’t remain in town for long, but if you feel you’ll need them, she’s a 9th-level cleric of the empyreal lord\n    Ashava (<em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</em> 82).\n  </p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>\n  <strong>Who is Audrahni?</strong> “She’s a traveling cleric of\n  @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.DJ7LDFTtns6YFodT]{Ashava}, the goddess of lonely spirits. She travels the\n  Lost Coast between Magnimar and Riddleport, helping to soothe unquiet spirits and comfort mourners. She stops here in\n  town a few times each year, and I always look forward to her visits—I love the people of Sandpoint dearly, and those\n  who attend my sermons are certainly devout, but there’s not many of them who are interested in long philosophical\n  discussions about history and religion. With Audrahni, I have a conversation partner who views me as her equal, not\n  someone who sees me as a religious leader.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Who is Naffer?</strong> “One of my dearest friends. He tends to the graves in the boneyard. He’s been worried\n  lately about strange sounds he’s been hearing in the graveyard at night, and we suspected that there was something\n  nefarious going on involving the Bunyip Club or smugglers or the like, but it appears to be something much worse.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Why not bring Nualia back to life?</strong> “That sort of magic is beyond me, but even if I could restore her\n  to life, I don’t know that she’d want to come back. Or if she did, if she’d be accepting of my forgiveness. I have no\n  illusions about her capacity for violence, and I fear that bringing her back from death might cause more harm than\n  good. But again, it’s not really an option... maybe something to consider in the future, though.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What do you think happened to her grave?</strong> “The subsidence, the claw marks on the underside of the\n  coffin, the missing body, and the tunnel it opens into all suggest ghouls to me. They must have burrowed up from below\n  to rob her grave.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>How can there be ghouls below the boneyard?</strong> “Ghouls have been a problem in the region for decades,\n  although not so much in recent years. I suppose I grew a bit complacent, but at the same time, they know how to hide\n  and avoid leaving traces. By not tunneling in areas of the graveyard that are in more frequent use, and by backfilling\n  those they defile, ghouls can go unnoticed for ages. Had I waited a few weeks more, no doubt they would have\n  backfilled Nualia’s grave as well, leaving me with a mysterious empty coffin but nowhere obvious to go from there, but\n  that says to me that the theft’s recent enough that her remains might still be recoverable.”\n</p>\n<section class=\"action\">\n  <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Actor.LTU4QwsWeLjdmRTg]{Abstalar Zantus}</span><span>Creature 7</span></h2>\n  <p>Human cleric of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.JgqH3BhuEuA4Zyqs]{Desna}</p>\n</section>"

He wants the PCs to crawl into the opened grave, to explore the tunnels below, and to\n  determine how extensive they are. If there are indeed ghouls lurking below, he asks that the PCs destroy them before\n  they can become a more severe threat to the town. If they can find Nualia’s remains, he would like the PCs to return\n  them—if not to serve as a focus for a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.gsYEuWv04XTDxe91]{Call Spirit} ritual, then simply to be able to put her back to rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the PCs ask Abstalar for his help, he promises to provide healing and other magical support at no cost to them in\n  return for their service, in addition to 75 gp per PC—funds drawn from the church’s upkeep and repair budget. He won’t\n  accompany them into the dark, citing the fact that his dungeon crawling days are far behind him. Before the PCs do\n  enter the tunnels, though, he supplies them with several consumables that will help: four\n  <em>lesser healing potions</em>, four <em>lesser antiplagues</em>, two <em>salves of antiparalysis</em>, and six\n  <em>vials of holy water</em>. Any of these supplies the PCs don’t use are, he adds, theirs to keep (@UUID[Actor.4N4MDWWPBJC3mWqO]{Supplies}).\n</p>\n<p>\n  When the PCs are ready to go, Abstalar leads them out into the boneyard behind the cathedral. Nualia was buried near\n  the western end of the boneyard, not far from the cathedral itself, in a spot set apart from the bulk of the other\n  graves (out of respect for the many townsfolk who balked at the idea of burying who they considered to be a\n  supernatural criminal too close to “respectable graves”). He’s had Naffer rig a frame and a tarp over the open grave\n  to prevent visitors from stumbling into it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Abstalar wishes the PCs luck in their venture, and warns them that if they find themselves in over their heads to beat\n  a hasty retreat back here, where he’ll be ready to help with healing as necessary.\n</p>"

With Nualia defeated and their own beloved and\n  frightening chieftain Ripnugget slain, the few surviving goblins scattered into the surrounding woods. Yet while\n  Nualia remained dead, Ripnugget’s rage and frustration mixed with the latent Abyssal energies that remained in the\n  area, and in time he rose from death as a graveknight.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ripnugget spent years venting his rage within the dungeons, occasionally rising up to the surface to butcher (or at\n  least frighten off) any goblins that had attempted to return to the lair.

Ripnugget recruited two ghouls to his cause, and before long, he’d had them infect a dozen\n  captured goblins with ghoul fever.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For the following few years, Ripnugget quietly groomed his goblin ghouls into a new tribe, periodically augmenting\n  their numbers with more captured goblins who were put through grueling tests. These tests determined if the captives\n  would be honored with the fever and eventual induction into the new tribe, or if they would instead be slaughtered,\n  left to ripen, and then laid out on Ripnugget’s banquet table.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It all fell apart just a few months ago, as Ripnugget was making final preparations to lead his goblin ghouls on a\n  devastating raid of\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11adoomedtown000#sandpointsettlement-4]{Sandpoint} when a band of\n  Seven Tooth goblins from nearby Shank’s Wood arrived to attack what\n  they’d come to fear as “hungry dead goblins.” The unexpected bravery of the Seven Tooths caught Ripnugget by surprise,\n  and the Seven Tooths managed to defeat the graveknight and destroy many of his ghouls through clever and aggressive\n  use of alchemical bombs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of course, one of the Seven Tooths sealed their own doom when they claimed Ripnugget’s armor as a trophy and, days\n  later, the graveknight was reborn from the atrophied, ruined body of the unfortunate goblin hero who’d claimed the\n  armor as his own. This time it was Ripnugget who had the advantage of surprise and he left the Seven Tooth village a\n  burning ruin. Yet the damage had been done. With his goblin ghoul army whittled down to a mere dozen, Ripnugget would\n  have to start the long process of rebuilding his army from the ground up.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was then that Ripnugget received a most unusual visit—a strange red seagull. At first, Ripnugget tried to catch the\n  gull, reasoning that a red gull would be extra spicy and delicious, but just before he lunged, the gull froze him in\n  his tracks by speaking directly into his mind, telling him of a powerful weapon he could use to burn Sandpoint to the\n  ground. To reach this weapon, he would need to send his ghouls under Sandpoint’s graveyard to dig into an old ruin\n  below the cathedral, while he himself would need to travel to the Pit to study ancient magic hidden within one of its\n  surrounding caverns. This manipulative red seagull was\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20012advent.JournalEntryPage.12theredbishop00]{The Red Bishop}, setting into motion one of the\n  final elements\n  of his master plan to groom a group of adventurers to unwittingly do his bidding.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ripnugget knew better than to doubt a “weird mind-talking spicy-bird” and quickly obeyed, sending his remaining\n  goblins to Sandpoint to contact the ghouls dwelling under the town’s boneyard and dig their way into the chambers\n  below the cathedral. While they did the hard work of digging tunnels, Ripnugget traveled to the Pit, where he\n  encountered a tribe of goblins even he didn’t know existed—the Whistlefangs. See\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20003whistl]{Chapter 3} for more details of\n  Ripnugget’s interactions with these goblins, and his progress toward deciphering the Hellstorm Flume.\n</p>"

Infiltrating the warrens below the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11sandpointbon00]{Sandpoint Boneyard} via underground tunnels from the north, the goblin ghouls made contact with the local ghouls who had quietly\n  and stealthily dwelled below the boneyard for years. These ghouls, led by a noteworthy ghoul named Wolgur Wrabs, had\n  never dared dig too closely to the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11sandpointcat00]{Sandpoint Cathedral}, but Wolgur had always wondered what might lie below the\n  church. He granted the goblins permission to expand their warrens on one condition—if they were discovered, they would\n  not reveal the presence of the other ghouls, and the link between the new tunnels below the cathedral and the older\n  ones under the boneyard would be hidden. In this way, Wolgur protected his own ghouls while having a chance to satisfy\n  his curiosity about the cathedral foundations.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of course, Wolgur’s fears about what lay in wait below the Sandpoint Cathedral were well founded, and when the goblin\n  ghouls broke through into the Hellstorm Catacombs, they were devastated by the guardians of the place. After a hasty\n  retreat that left their numbers nearly halved, the leader of these goblins, a cleric of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.V5PbbkZUP9N7kl6h]{Kabriri} named Glorkus, grew\n  nervous. After all, he was a favorite of Ripnugget’s and had been tasked with leading this expedition—once Ripnugget\n  discovered that he’d lost five of the ghouls to demons and traps, he’d be lucky to still have a head to beg for\n  forgiveness with, much less remain his leader’s favorite.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Wolgur took pity on him and revealed a means by which he might earn some favor with Ripnugget. He informed Glorkus\n  that their tribe’s one-time “heroine,” Nualia, was buried in a grave above. Glorkus saw salvation in her bones,\n  knowing that Ripnugget harbored a grudge against the woman for her actions that brought heroes down on Thistletop. He\n  sent his crew to rob her grave from below, hoping to find a way to bring her back from death as a gift to Ripnugget in\n  replacement for the ghouls Glorkus lost. So far, his attempts to infuse life into her bones have met with failure, and\n  each day that passes with her remains remaining uneaten, the other ghouls in his band grow more eager to chew her\n  bones and get a bit of revenge of their own.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Such is the state of the goblin ghouls when the PCs arrive—with their numbers reduced, frustrations with Glorkus\n  growing, and a nagging fear that when Ripnugget arrives he’ll be very disappointed. They’ll see the PC’s arrival in\n  their warrens as one more chance to make the best of a bad thing… if only they can catch the PCs and turn them into\n  replacement ghouls!\n</p>"

While the ancient fire-spewing weapon has crumbled (leaving behind the ruined tower known today as the Old\n  Light), the magic within these pylons is still very active and, given time, could become a great boon or danger to the\n  people of Sandpoint.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The chambers within the catacombs are all well lit by numerous <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.ynm8JIU3sc3qUMpa]</em> spells cast on carvings of\n  seven-pointed stars—the infamous Sihedron of Thassilon that symbolizes that nation’s seven runelords—on the walls and\n  ceilings of these chambers, giving each room a flickering fiery glow. The ceiling height in most rooms and halls is 8\n  feet.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Note that while the Hellstorm Catacombs have plenty of headroom compared to the goblin ghoul warrens, these chambers\n  are confining in another way—the rooms are relatively small and the hallways narrow, making it complicated for a large\n  party to maneuver in the catacombs. With the exception of area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20001bonesa.JournalEntryPage.01hellstormfoc00]{B10}, combat encounters are limited to\n  one foe, and skew toward the Trivial or Low end of things to account for the likelihood of the party having limited\n  mobility in these spaces.\n</p>"

Each\n  door’s handle features a tiny little metal basket that looks like it’s meant to hold a small bead-shaped object.\n</p>\n<p>The northernmost room has an additional feature instead of a red wall with doors to the north:</p>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">\n  To the north of this room, the wall curves in a semicircle. A single red stone statue of an angry woman holding a\n  ranseur stands to the north, her weapon held in one hand pointed toward the southern doors, while her other hand\n  reaches out with a cupped palm, as if expecting a gift. The ranseur itself appears to be a real weapon, and not an\n  integrated part of the statue itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A character who succeeds on a @Check[society|dc:19|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall\n  Knowledge] check to Recall Knowledge recognizes the statue as depicting Runelord\n  Alaznist, the ruler of the lands west of what is now the western coast of Varisia in the pre-Earthfall era.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Runelord Alaznist only rarely visited these chambers, as the threat of the Hellstorm Flume was enough to keep enemies\n  away from her borders. In order to make sure those stationed here never forgot who was in charge, they were expected\n  to perform a weekly “check in”—reporting to the statue of Alaznist in area <strong>B4c</strong>, with the knowledge\n  that someone, perhaps even Alaznist herself, was watching through the statue’s eyes. Even reaching the statue to make\n  their report was fraught: Navigating these three rooms—the “Three Steps”—required knowing the correct set of triggers,\n  which were under the control of the catacombs’ commander; minions who needed punishment were set up for failure by\n  being given incorrect codes. With this method, even those who had pleased the commander were never sure they had done\n  well until they reached the statue and gave their report, which served well to keep everyone on their toes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The latest pattern for navigating the Three Steps has remained unchanged for thousands of years, as the catacombs’\n  commander perished during Earthfall. For safe passage, those traversing the chambers must set garnet beads into the\n  little metal baskets on the door handles, going from least valuable to most valuable, south to north, and culminating\n  in the placement of the 7th, most valuable garnet bead in the upturned palm of the statue of Alaznist in area\n  <strong>B4c</strong>. A full set of these garnet beads can be found in area\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20001bonesa.JournalEntryPage.01abraxasshrin00]{B3}, and instructions for\n  how to use them can be found in area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20001bonesa.JournalEntryPage.01commandersst00]{B6a}.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The doors in the walls here are all made of stone, none of them are locked, and they all open to the south. However,\n  if a door is opened without the correct garnet bead having been placed into its handle’s basket, the trap in the room\n  to the north becomes armed. Placing the garnet bead worth 2 gp in <strong>B4a’s</strong> southern door disarms the\n  trap in area <strong>B4a</strong>. Placing a 5 gp garnet bead in the two doors between areas <strong>B4a</strong> and\n  <strong>B4b</strong> disarms the trap in area <strong>B4b</strong>. Placing the three 10 gp garnet beads in the\n  northernmost three doors disarms the trap in area <strong>B4c</strong>.

She settles down in one of the rooms in the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11sandpointcat00]{Sandpoint Cathedral}, so a great time to have Abstalar introduce her\n  to the party is after they emerge from a particularly grueling session of exploration below. Audrahni is a\n  pale-skinned, dark-haired elven woman who dresses in somber colors and, unlike most elves, moves with a somewhat\n  awkward gait and has a slumped posture. This awkwardness was once reflected in her introverted personality, but after\n  her adventures with a group of heroes who went on to face Runelord Alaznist herself only a few years ago, she’s\n  regained her faith and has more confidence and a much friendlier demeanor.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As a worshipper of Ashava, the empyreal lord of dancers, lonely spirits, and moonlight, Audrahni is a quite capable\n  healer, and if the PCs are wounded or need divine aid when she meets them, she’s eager and willing to provide healing\n  for them, free of charge. More importantly, she fully supports Abstalar’s plan to call upon Nualia’s spirit to forgive\n  her—for from what Audrahni understands, the aasimar’s soul is very likely the definition of one of the lonely spirits\n  her faith urges her to guide and assist.\n</p>"

Audrahni explains that the particulars of Nualia’s\n  death, her past with @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11adoomedtown000#sandpointsettlement-4]{Sandpoint}, the passage of nearly two decades of time, and the desecration of her remains all make\n  for a less than ideal set of circumstances for calling her spirit. It will take all of her focus, as well as\n  Abstalar’s, to ensure that Nualia’s spirit can be properly called, and even then, there’s a chance that restless\n  spirits might arrive as well. If this happens, Abstalar and Audrahni must focus on blocking those spirits from\n  fighting their way through to potentially become dangerous undead—which would leave the PCs with the responsibility of\n  not only helping to shore up the ritual’s magic, but to be the ones to speak to Nualia’s spirit if she answers. If the\n  PCs are unsure of what to ask Nualia, Abstalar coaches them. While Audrahni hopes this won’t be necessary, her concern\n  is real, and she fears that the PCs will very much be needed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The best way to contact a spirit in this case, Audrahni explains, is under moonlight, and so she and Abstalar intend\n  to perform the ritual at night in the open-air cathedral courtyard. They plan to perform the ritual on the next clear\n  night, an hour after sunset when the moon shines down into the courtyard. While moonlight is essential for the ritual,\n  a few extra lanterns won’t hurt. If not all the PCs can see well in dim light, Abstalar recommends the PCs set up some\n  lanterns in the courtyard as the ritual begins.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It takes an hour to cast the ritual, during which time Audrahni and Abstalar focus on the chanting, lighting candles\n  and incense, and other rites required to beckon Nualia’s spirit. They ask the PCs to be on hand but indicate that it\n  won’t be until the ritual is almost complete that they’ll know if things have gone awry. Regardless, she briefs the\n  PCs on methods they can use to aid them. In the meantime, the PCs are expected to wait nearby while the ritual\n  commences. Once things begin, faint whorls of moonlight begin to manifest, and the PCs can get glimpses of dim figures\n  starting to dance in a circle around the two casters. As the hour goes on, these manifestations of the magic grow more\n  and more obvious, with an unnerving chill settling into the air.\n</p>"

He meets them once more on the courtyard veranda in the cathedral, and while\n  he appears a bit haggard, he’s eager to speak to the PCs about what took place the night before. Audrahni attends this\n  meeting as well, but is dressed for travel. She intends to leave town immediately to continue her trip north toward\n  Roderic’s Cove, where she plans to spend the rest of the year. If the PCs did well the night before, she thanks them\n  for their aid and wishes them luck in their adventures ahead. Abstalar thanks her for all she’s done, and as she\n  leaves, she quietly thanks her friend and nods farewell to PCs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once Audrahni leaves, Abstalar thanks the PCs once more as well. If any of them are still wounded, he uses\n  <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.rfZpqmj0AIIdkVIs]{Heal}</em> spells\n  to attend to them, then asks for their opinion as to what to make of Nualia’s words. In particular, Abstalar is\n  concerned about these “seven dooms” that Nualia mentioned. Let the PCs take this time to talk over the ramifications\n  of what they’ve learned from both Nualia and any of their explorations of the\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20001bonesa.JournalEntryPage.01thehellstorm00]{Hellstorm Catacombs}. If they are\n  concerned about the mention of Ripnugget’s name by the goblins below, or about the nature and presence of the\n  catacombs, Abstalar shares their concern. He also asks them what they make of the number seven, noting (if the PCs\n  don’t) that seven was a particularly important number in old Thassilon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Abstalar’s adventuring days are far behind him today, but he recognizes the potential threat well enough. The past few\n  decades have been difficult for\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11adoomedtown000#sandpointsettlement-4]{Sandpoint}. The town’s\n  endured devastating fires, pattern killer rampages, goblin\n  raids, an attack by stone giants and a red dragon, a strange and unnatural sinkhole in the middle of the upper town,\n  and not one but two tsunamis that, but for the town’s fortuitous topography and surroundings, could have wreaked much\n  more devastation. Abstalar recognizes the early signs of peril, and Nualia’s unsettling proclamations the night before\n  have convinced him that some dire plot is brewing southeast of town in the Pit.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As the conversation goes on, allow the PCs a chance to attempt\n  @Check[perception|dc:25|traits:concentrate,secret,action:sense-motive|name:Sense Motive]{Sense Motive} checks against\n  Abstalar. On a\n  success, they note more apprehension and even nervous anticipation in his manner. If the PCs confront him on this\n  front, he sighs and admits that Nualia’s words hit him hard, as he’s realized that she was right about how Sandpoint\n  failed her, and he fears that the same elements in the small town that set into motion her acts 17 years ago have only\n  festered in that time into something worse.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Abstalar asks the PCs for help. He wants them to travel southeast to the Pit, investigate the site, and determine if\n  there’s truth to the ghoul’s claims that Ripnugget has taken up residence there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the PCs managed to reach influence 9 with Nualia, he also asks the PCs to keep a keen eye out for any other dangers\n  that may be building while they explore the notorious location. He promises to provide healing for them, free of\n  charge, whenever they return to the cathedral.\n</p>"

As they soon learn, the perils, revelations, and\n  rewards they can find in the Pit are much greater than even Abstalar anticipates, and while the bulk of this adventure\n  takes place in the dungeon chambers that surround that cylindrical chasm, there remains plenty for the PCs to do back\n  in town in between their forays.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While there are seven separate dooms looming in Sandpoint’s future, this adventure isn’t on a timer. You should allow\n  the PCs to set the pace of their explorations in the Pit, and when they return to Sandpoint, let them explore the town\n  and spend downtime as they see fit. The @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo]{Sandpoint Gazetteer} provides details on how the PCs can\n  build reputations with many of the town’s significant citizens, but as time goes on, other events will come into play\n  as well. Some of these are one-off developments that the PCs will have a chance to handle (and perhaps use to bolster\n  their own reputations, especially if they decide they want to become more involved in the town’s political scene),\n  while others are triggered by developments in the Pit itself as the PCs begin to defeat the leaders of the various\n  factions that hold power therein. This chapter focuses on all of the adventures that take place in and around\n  Sandpoint, with advice on when these developments should take place and how they might be solved. You don’t have to\n  make sure every one of these encounters plays out, but they can provide the PCs with the additional experience,\n  resources, support, and clues they need to succeed in the deeper layers of the Pit.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Unlike the later chapters of this book (or the first one, for that matter), the encounters and events presented in\n  this chapter are meant to challenge a wide range of levels (although they skew to the lower half of the level range\n  the PCs reach in this adventure). These developments are presented roughly in the order in which they should take\n  place during “Seven Dooms for Sandpoint” as the PCs level up. Each event is presented with a level as well, to help\n  guide you as to when you should stage these events and encounters—these events can occur at any time after the PCs\n  reach the corresponding level.\n</p>"

Despite its name, the Hellstorm Flume had\n    no direct association with Hell itself—it was so called for its ability to emit a flume of searing fire at\n    extraordinary range to blast approaching armies with a devastating inferno.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>6 Research Points</strong> The strange stones below the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11sandpointcat00]{Sandpoint Cathedral} are magically linked to the\n    Hellstorm Flume still, despite the tower’s ruined state—it appears that the stones were used to activate, focus, and\n    aim the Flume’s fires, but the magic remaining within the stones today is barely enough to maintain the link to the\n    Old Light... as long as they remain in their current, decrepit state.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>10 Research Points</strong> The <em>Hellstorm Focus</em> once controlled the Hellstorm Flume, but it also\n    served as a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5ZW1w9f4gWlSIuWA]{Teleportation Circle}</em>.

This is, of course, entirely false. At your discretion, the source of this rumor might be a\n  local ruffian hoping to get in good with the Bunyip Club (Sandpoint’s thieves’ guild) and they might just send the PCs\n  into an ambush. In this case, if the PCs investigate this false lead, they’re attacked on site by four bandits (<em>Gamemastery Guide</em>\n  208) who hope to rob the PCs and buy their way into the Bunyip Club with the spoils. These bandits panic and flee if\n  any of them are reduced to 10 HP or fewer; if captured, they beg for mercy and confess to the whole lie.\n</p>"

As a member of the town council, Abstalar takes his seat at the large table at the head of\n  the hall along with the other six councillors, and indicates the PCs should be seated nearby in the small seating just\n  to the west of the table reserved for guest speakers—doing so effectively puts them on display for the rest of the\n  room to watch, and the PCs should not miss the mix of curious, admiring, and suspicious glances sent their direction\n  from the gathered citizens.\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n  <img style=\"transform:scale(1)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/mm_logo_blue.svg\" alt=\"MetaMorphic Digital Studio\" title=\"MetaMorphic Digital Studio\" />\n  <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Scene Notes</span><span class=\"keepme\">Ambiance</span></h2>\n  <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Playlist.jiZHhpRzijFnRfaE.PlaylistSound.D4u7iwIDXYgPtFzY]{Town Hall Meeting Calm} @UUID[Playlist.jiZHhpRzijFnRfaE.PlaylistSound.hbXK0KK0gubf7yBJ]{Town Hall Meeting Angry}</span>\n  </div>\n</section>\n\n<p>\n  The meeting has only one agenda item—a discussion about whether or not Abstalar Zantus has put Sandpoint at risk by\n  contacting the spirit of one of the town’s most notorious enemies. Mayor Kendra Deverin calls the meeting to order,\n  taking a moment to recount Nualia’s role in the goblin raids that struck Sandpoint 17 years ago. If your players\n  aren’t familiar with these events (which were presented in the first adventure of Rise of the Runelords, “Burnt\n  Offerings”) this is a great chance to fill them in. She then recalls that Nualia’s burial many years ago in the town’s\n  boneyard was a contentious decision, but with the advice and support of the heroes who played a role in her defeat, it\n  was decided that burying her in town was the right choice. As she speaks, the PCs can attempt a @Check[perception|dc:22|traits:concentrate,secret,action:sense-motive|name:Sense Motive] Check\n  to Sense Motive on Kendra—on a success, they detect a note of impatience and annoyance in her voice at those who’ve\n  raised so many objections about Abstalar’s concern for the safety of the town. As she finishes, she turns to Abstalar\n  and asks him to explain the reasoning and process behind performing the ritual.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Abstalar explains himself clearly and patiently, despite a few catcalls and guffaws from Charn’s bloc in the audience.\n  He doesn’t go into the details of the ritual itself, claiming that the words of the dead should not be made a\n  spectacle of in public, but does admit that while Nualia was never a danger to the town, she did warn that other\n  dangers still exist. Here, Abstalar is coy as well, knowing that if there are indeed enemies of the town dwelling in\n  Sandpoint, it’s best not to let them know too much. If during the ritual shadows attacked and the PCs defeated them,\n  Abstalar takes the time to thank the PCs, and regardless of that event, indicates that their presence helped to ensure\n  nothing went wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At this point, Kendra turns to the PCs and asks them to corroborate Abstalar’s story. Allow each character a chance to\n  speak, and ask each player to attempt a @Check[deception|dc:19], @Check[diplomacy|dc:19] or @Check[intimidation|dc:19] check, depending on the tenor of\n  their presentation. If the PCs mentioned the presence of ghouls, strange catacombs, or other frightening elements,\n  their words worry the crowd and they suffer a circumstance penalty of –1 per unsettling mention, to a maximum penalty\n  of –4. The results of this check determine what happens next.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Every PC succeeds at their check:</strong> The audience grows quiet, Charn included (although he casts several\n  dark glances in the PCs’ direction), and when Kendra turns to the gathered crowd and asks if anyone has questions or\n  wishes to pursue their claims that Abstalar put the town at risk, no one raises an objection. Kendra nods in\n  satisfaction, thanks everyone for their time, and adjourns the meeting. Grant the PCs 80 XP, and 1 Reputation Point to\n  every @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11sandpointsfa00]{Faction}—even sour-faced Titus Scarnetti has to admit, if only to himself, that he’s impressed with how the PCs\n  handled themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>At least half (but not all) of the PCs succeed at their check:</strong> While most of the audience is appeased\n  and relieved, Charn and his kin are not. One of the other councillors, Titus Scarnetti, raises a hand to indicate he\n  wishes to speak. Kendra grants him the floor, and he gives an impassioned speech about how it’s best to leave the past\n  buried, how even the best intentioned adventuring parties can cause harm, and worries that if “this necromantic\n  mummer’s show isn’t punished, what happens the next time when someone tries their own hand at this magic?” He ends his\n  speech implying that Abstalar’s time as the town’s religious leader has been valuable and appreciated, but wonders if,\n  perhaps, it’s time for new religious leadership that lets the dead rest in peace to take over. He asks that Abstalar\n  be fined for his actions at the very least. Kendra seems ready to object, but Abstalar accepts this, much to Titus’s\n  surprise. He apologizes for taking the town’s trust too far, and to atone for this, he promises to use this\n  opportunity to donate his time, magic, resources, and funds toward improving the farm roads south of town—a project\n  that’s languished in bureaucratic red tape for years, and one that turns most of the crowd’s wary fears into relieved\n  cheers—much to Titus’s (and Charn’s) frustration. Grant the PCs 60 XP, 1 Reputation Point to the Sandpoint Cathedral\n  and the Townsfolk, and subtract 1 Reputation Point from Scarnetti Consortium.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Less than half (but at least one) of the PCs succeed at their check:</strong> The PCs’ words do more harm than\n  good. Titus Scarnetti sits back and remains silent, a smug smirk on his face revealing his delight that the PCs put a\n  proverbial foot in their collective mouths. Charn stands up and demands restitution and an accounting for this risky\n  ritual, claiming that it’s only luck that prevented an army of ghosts and ghouls from invading from beyond, and that\n  next time Sandpoint might not be so lucky. Kendra calls for order, and after a few minutes, her face heavy, she orders\n  Abstalar to pay a hefty fine and to refrain from performing “unsanctioned rituals” in the future. It’s a political\n  slap on the wrist that shames Kendra and Abstalar, isn’t enough to appease the Scarnettis, and leaves the town in just\n  as much doubt as before, but no further repercussions come. Grant the PCs 20 XP, but they lose 1 Reputation Point from\n  every faction except for the Sandpoint Cathedral.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>No PC succeeds at their check:</strong> Total disaster! It’s only through luck and Kendra’s skill at\n  diplomacy, with able assistance from the other councillors (save for Titus, who simply sits back and chortles in\n  delight) that prevents a full-fledged riot. She promises to pursue a deeper investigation of Abstalar’s motives, has\n  guards posted in the cathedral for a few weeks to ensure nothing else dangerous takes place, and orders a hefty fine\n  and community service from Abstalar. Her faith in her friend has been shaken by the PCs’ ruinous testimony, but not\n  destroyed. The PCs earn no XP, and lose 3 Reputation Points from every faction.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>After the Meeting:</strong> Once the meeting is adjourned, Kendra asks the PCs and Abstalar to remain for a\n  bit, so she can either thank them for helping keep the peace or warn them about using their words to fan flames,\n  depending on how their checks went. She also warns Abstalar that Titus is not satisfied, and seems to have an agenda\n  beyond “protecting the people from evil spirits,” and he may well be a thorn in the cathedral’s side for some time.\n  She then asks the PCs what they intend to do next; they’ve been involved in one scandal already, so if there’s a\n  chance they might start another she wants to be prepared. She’s concerned about the presence of ruins below the\n  cathedral, and enjoins Abstalar to make sure the catacombs are safe, but if the PCs tell her that they’re heading to\n  the Pit, her eyes widen and she warns them to take care—“The Pit is far from a safely conducted ritual on hallowed\n  grounds, after all.”\n</p>"

They avoid digging up into the graves from below, for\n  fear that doing so would result in the exact situation that the goblins caused by robbing Nualia’s grave. These ghouls\n  have been stockpiling resources and building plans for a dangerous raid on the cemetery known as Paupers’ Graves to\n  the east, hoping to supplant the more dangerous and cruel ghouls there to claim the site as their own, but have grown\n  complacent and comfortable here under\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11adoomedtown000#sandpointsettlement-4]{Sandpoint}.\n</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 WOLGUR WRABS.webp\" alt=\"Wolgur Wrabs, male ghast\" title=\"Wolgur Wrabs\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 WOLGUR WRABS.webp')\" />\n<p>\n  The 12 @UUID[Actor.Y2MPAnJ3YzL5v9BH]{Ghouls} are led by a ghast named Wolgur Wrabs. Wolgur is no fool, despite having\n  decided to dwell so close to\n  potential enemies, and once he realizes that the PCs have discovered his people, he swiftly moves to make contact with\n  them, hoping to have a diplomatic discussion. The PCs can certainly just storm into the warrens and attack Wolgur, but\n  a fight against 12 ghouls and Wolgur is an Extreme 5 encounter. If Wolgur is slain, though, the remaining ghouls panic\n  and flee, using tunnels that wind north and connect via secret doors to the smuggler’s tunnels, hoping to escape\n  further into the underground of the region. Defeating Wolgur is one surefire way to end the ghoul threat.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A safer route is diplomacy. If the PCs agree to talk, Wolgur presents himself as a very polite and well-mannered\n  ghast—he even takes care to never approach more than 10 feet, as he knows his scent “is a bit overwhelming to the\n  unprepared.” Wolgur notes that he and the other ghouls have been living below Sandpoint without bothering anyone for\n  years, and as evidence he points out the extensive support work he and his ghouls have laid up in the warrens to\n  prevent subsidence. He promises to continue to leave the topside alone, and further promises to meet any attempts by\n  goblin ghouls to move into the region with violence. Wolgur is sincere in his promises, as a\n  @Check[perception|dc:20|traits:concentrate,secret,action:sense-motive|name:Sense Motive] check to\n  Sense Motive can confirm, but he remains evil and unsettling.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To sweeten the deal and prove his intentions, Wolgur offers the PCs a tithe in the form of a minor sturdy shield, a\n  wand of ray of enfeeblement, and a pair of goggles of night (@UUID[Actor.rAgfSegC16nP6PDc]{Wolgur's Tithe}), asking them to take the items as gifts and as proof of\n  his promise to remain hidden. He only asks for the PCs’ signatures on a contract that confirms they’ve given him\n  permission to remain. This contract is on a strip of unpleasant-looking parchment that seems to have a sailor’s tattoo\n  on it. If they sign, Wolgur keeps the parchment and gives the PCs the treasures, promising that he’ll never see them\n  again before he and his ghouls retreat into the warrens.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the PCs demand he and his ghouls abandon the tunnel, they’ll need to convince him that leaving town is in his own\n  best interest. Wolgur is friendly to the PCs at the moment, so they can attempt a\n  @Check[diplomacy|dc:21|traits:action:request,auditory,concentrate,linguistic,mental|name:Request] check to Request the\n  ghouls relocate. Alternatively, a\n  @Check[intimidation|dc:20|traits:auditory,concentrate,emotion,exploration,linguistic,mental,skill,action:coerce|name:Coerce]\n  check to Coerce them convinces Wolgur to pack up and leave.

Once they do, the PCs make an intriguing discovery: the <em>Hellstorm Focus</em> was used\n  for more than just the activation and control of a fiery weapon. It was also a portal Runelord Alaznist used to come\n  and go from the region quickly. While the portal to which the <em>Hellstorm Focus</em> was once linked is either\n  inactive or destroyed, and thus it can’t be used to travel to its original location, it could be linked to other\n  Thassilonian portals—such as those the PCs begin to discover as they explore the Pit.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To link the <em>Hellstorm Focus</em> to any of the inactive\n  <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5ZW1w9f4gWlSIuWA]{Teleportation Circles}</em> in the Pit, the PCs must first\n  realign the <em>Hellstorm Focus</em>’s energies away from the ruins of the Old Light, transitioning the energies from\n  evocation to conjuration. A character who is expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion can refocus these\n  energies by spending an hour in physical contact with the <em>Hellstorm Focus</em> and then succeeding at a\n  @Check[arcana|dc:30], @Check[nature|dc:30], @Check[occultism|dc:30] or @Check[religion|dc:30]\n  skill check.

But, ever since the goblin attack on town 17 years\n  ago (coincidentally when Charn himself turned 17 and was primed to start taking on a larger role in his father’s\n  business), things haven’t gone well for the Scarnettis. A grisly murder at the Scarnettis’ lumber mill in town not\n  long after the goblin raid set back the family’s productivity for months, and then when Sandpoint was attacked by\n  giants and a dragon, Scarnetti Manor suffered extensive damage. During the cleanup and repair work, evidence of\n  collusion between the Scarnettis and the Bunyip Club came to light, and rather than focus on rebuilding their home and\n  business, the family was forced to go on a legal defensive for years.\n</p>\n<p>\n  By the time the family regained its footing a few years ago with the establishment of the Scarnetti Consortium, Charn\n  had grown frustrated with what he perceived to be a combination of his father’s failure to manage the business he\n  viewed as his by right, and the constant meddling of adventurers stirring up trouble. Charn’s attempt to discredit\n  Abstalar and work up a panic over his plan to contact Nualia’s spirit is the result of his insecurity and\n  frustrations, as well as his fear of seeing another group of adventurers potentially causing trouble. His other\n  motivation is an attempt to build up his own reputation in town as a “protector of the people.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  Charn’s focus shifts away from Abstalar and toward the PCs once the ritual is finished and no significant fallout\n  takes place, especially once he learns that the PCs have begun exploring the Pit. He spends his time in town spreading\n  rumors and stoking fears. Everyone knows the Pit is dangerous, but left alone, its perils are self-contained. Who\n  knows what sorts of trouble a group of irresponsible “heroes” might stir up by delving into it to look for personal\n  glory and treasure?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Every time the PCs return from an expedition to the Pit and spend at least an hour in Sandpoint, allow them to attempt\n  a @Check[perception|dc:20] check. On a success, they overhear whispers, catch side-eye glances, or otherwise become aware that\n  some of the people in town seem not to trust them. On a critical success, a PC hears someone mutter something like\n  “Those are the ones Charn told me of—who knows what trouble they’re stirring up in that old Pit?” A PC can also learn\n  that Charn’s been spreading rumors by investigating on their own—either via Gathering Information for 2 hours and\n  succeeding at a @Check[diplomacy|dc:22|traits:exploration,skill,secret,action:gather-information|name:Gather Information] check, or by directly confronting someone they overhear mentioning Charn’s name and\n  successfully Coercing or Requesting the information with a @Check[intimidation|dc:22|traits:auditory,concentrate,emotion,exploration,linguistic,mental,skill,action:coerce|name:Coerce] or @Check[diplomacy|dc:22|traits:action:request,auditory,concentrate,linguistic,mental|name:Request] check.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Charn’s campaign of misinformation erodes their reputation. As long as he continues, every time the PCs return from\n  the Pit, they lose 1 @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11sandpointsfa00]{Reputation Point} from the Sandpoint Mercantile League, the Town Watch, and the Townsfolk. Keep\n  track of Reputation Points lost in this manner, since if the PCs can publicly discredit Charn, they’ll earn the lost\n  points back, but if they take violent steps to solve the problem, those lost points cannot be recovered so easily.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A PC can work against Charn’s campaign via public displays of good will. Any of the following actions allow the PCs to\n  regain 1 lost Reputation Point from a faction of their choice.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Donations:</strong> If the PCs make a donation worth at least 100 gp to a faction, Charn’s rumors won’t cost\n  the PCs additional Reputation Points with that faction for 1 week, but any points already lost remain lost.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Good Behavior:</strong> Once per day, a PC can spend 4 hours being publicly charming, helpful, and pleasant to\n  the citizens of Sandpoint to try to fight against Charn’s rumors. This requires a successful @Check[diplomacy|dc:20] check. On\n  a success, the PCs regain 1 lost Reputation Point from a faction of their choice, but on a critical failure, they lose\n  1 additional Reputation Point from one of the three factions, determined randomly.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Performances:</strong> Once per day, a PC can spend 2 hours giving a free public performance to entertain the\n  locals. On a successful @Check[performance|dc:20] check, the PCs regain 1 lost Reputation Point from the Townsfolk. On a\n  critical success, the PCs also regain 1 lost Reputation Point from the Town Watch.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Stopping Charn:</strong> While killing Charn or running him out of town stops him from spreading rumors, such\n  acts prove to the factions that the PCs are troublemakers, and their lost points remain lost. If the PCs become liked\n  by the Scarnetti Consortium, Charn decides they’re on his side and ceases his plot. If the PCs are at least liked by a\n  faction, Charn’s rumors no longer erode Reputation Points from that faction. If the PCs become liked by all three of\n  the factions, or if the PCs convince him to stop his rumormongering by succeeding at five of the above countermeasures\n  in the span of a single week, Charn gives up his plans and pursues a different plot by recruiting his cousin Adimar to\n  help against the PCs—see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20002strang.JournalEntryPage.02dinneratther00]{Dinner at the Rusty Dragon}.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Reward:</strong> Grant the PCs 60 XP for stopping Charn without resorting to violence, but doing so reduces\n  their Reputation Points with the Scarnetti Consortium by 2. At this time, with their reputation restored, they regain\n  any points they lost due to Charn’s interference.\n</p>"

These rumors\n  continue to build, and as the PCs reach 6th level, discoveries of the scorched hoofprints begin to show up in town as\n  well.\n</p>\n<p>\n  One night, one of the PCs might even hear a loud thump, followed by the sound of hoofbeats on the roof above where\n  they’re sleeping. If they’re quick to the window and succeed at a @Check[perception|dc:25] check, they might just catch a\n  glimpse of a large flying shape retreating into the foggy night. An investigation of their roof reveals more of the\n  strange scorched hoofprints.\n</p>\n<p>\n  These signs are indeed left by the Sandpoint Devil as it begins to haunt Sandpoint, but the creature remains elusive\n  until the end of Chapter 4, when it comes out of hiding in a violent attack.

If the PCs have been looking for @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20002strang.JournalEntryPage.02lookingforar00]{Arika Avertin}, then they should also learn that she’s one of these\n  adventurers—part of a group recently returned from Magnimar. As it turns out, this group has heard of the PCs as well,\n  and it’s not long before a messenger delivers an invitation from the group’s boss, Kaleb Valdemar, to a private dinner\n  to “compare stories” that evening at the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11therustydrag00]{Rusty Dragon}. While you likely won’t need a map of this establishment to run\n  this influence encounter, <em>Pathfinder Flip-Mat: The Rusty Dragon Inn</em>\n  presents the location in full detail.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The group is sponsored by Kaleb Valdemar, scion of the Valdemar family. Several years ago, the Valdemars, as one of\n  the founding families of Sandpoint, maintained a presence here in town, but with the death of the family patriarch,\n  they boarded up their local manor and returned to the city of Magnimar, where business ventures were more profitable.\n  Among these ventures was a sponsorship for a group of adventurers that Kaleb keeps on the family payroll for various\n  mercenary duties. The group just recently finished hunting down and exposing a small-time criminal ring that foolishly\n  attempted to blackmail the Valdemars, thought it cost the life of one of their own—a cleric of Calistria named Jhyosa.\n</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar float-right\">\n  <h1>Further Details</h1>\n  <p>\n    The PCs aren’t likely to be fighting these adventurers at this time, but that won’t be the case the next time they\n    meet. Should you need any of their statistics beyond those included in their influence stat blocks during this\n    dinner, you can find them later in @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20007apatte]{Chapter 7} (for Adimar, Chertus, and Arika) or @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20008wherec]{Chapter 8} (for Tiluatchek as\n    Kaleb).\n  </p>\n</aside>\n<p>\n  The group consists of three very different individuals, but they all share one thing in common—they’re all Sandpoint\n  locals. <strong>Adimar Scarnetti</strong> (LE male wererat rogue 8) is the nephew of Titus Scarnetti, and secretly a\n  wererat to boot. <strong>Chertus Jheed</strong> (CE male human fighter 7) is a small-time criminal who hopes to some\n  day supplant the leadership of the Bunyip Club. And finally, <strong>Arika Avertin</strong> (N female human bard 6) is\n  a rebellious woman who turned her back on her mother’s candy shop in order to seek an exciting adventurer’s lifestyle.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the PCs accept the invitation, they find the other adventurers and Kaleb already waiting for them when they arrive\n  at the Rusty Dragon. They’ve pulled two of the circular tables in the tavern’s main room into the southwest corner,\n  and wave the PCs over to the empty chairs upon spotting their entrance. The other adventurers are a few mugs of mead\n  ahead and have already ordered—plates of curried salmon with green beans, cheese blossoms (spicy cheese curd–stuffed\n  artichoke hearts), and fresh loaves of bread arrive at the table soon after the PCs are seated.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Kaleb stands up to greet the PCs, welcoming them in a booming voice and asking them to get comfortable. A glance\n  around the table reveals that Adimar is leaning back against the wall in his chair as he eyes the PCs appraisingly,\n  Chertus is eagerly digging into a plate of cheese blossoms, and Arika is morosely staring into a half-empty mug of\n  raspberry mead.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In truth, Kaleb is more than he seems, although his adventuring agents don’t realize this. The actual Kaleb Valdemar\n  has been dead for years, and the “man” at the table facing the PCs is but a meat shell being worn by the leader of the\n  Midnight Dawn: an intellect devourer named Tiluatchek. He’s heard rumors of the new adventuring group in town, and has\n  invited them to a dinner with his “pet adventurers” in order to size them up and determine if they might be a threat\n  to his local operation.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As the dinner begins, Kaleb eagerly asks the PCs to recount stories of their adventures in the Pit. If they agree,\n  Adimar leans forward and seems quite interested, although he keeps wearing a smug, superior smirk. Chertus snorts in\n  disbelief now and then at the PCs’ claims. Arika seems legitimately intrigued by the PCs’ adventures in the Pit, and\n  now and then interjects with questions about their discoveries in the dungeon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The PCs have opportunities during the dinner to learn more about the others as well, but to do so, they need to\n  Influence each of the other NPCs as the evening progresses. During the 90 minutes the feast goes on, the PCs have\n  three 30-minute rounds to Discover NPC preferences and Influence them to learn information. How well the influencing\n  goes can further impact things when the PCs encounter these adventurers in much different circumstances later in the\n  adventure.

He grew up admiring\n    Jubrayl, leader of the Bunyip Club, but as he got older, that admiration soured to jealousy—he desperately wants to\n    run the club himself, and hopes that by “making it big” while adventuring, he’ll be able to secure the funds to have\n    Jubrayl “retired,” one way or another.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Appearance</strong> Chertus is a tall, solidly built Varisian man. He carries his weight well, having\n    learned that his bulk often gives him a psychological edge in arguments, even though not all of his mass is from\n    muscle. He cuts his own hair and has a short, scruffy beard that gives him a slightly unkempt look, especially\n    combined with his dirty gear. If anyone comments on his somewhat disheveled appearance, Chertus is quick to assert\n    that “real adventurers” don’t have time to waste on tidiness, but truthfully he just can’t be bothered.\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>Personality</strong> abrasive, stubborn, talks with his mouth full</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"action\">\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Arika Avertin</h2>\n  <ul class=\"traits\">\n    <li class=\"trait\">N</li>\n    <li class=\"trait\">Medium</li>\n    <li class=\"trait\">human</li>\n    <li class=\"trait\">Humanoid</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Rebellious adventurer who’s having second thoughts</p>\n  <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 ARIKA AVERTIN.webp\" alt=\"Arika Avertin, female human adventurer\" title=\"Arika Avertin\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 ARIKA AVERTIN.webp')\" />\n  <p><strong>Perception</strong> +10</p>\n  <p><strong>Will</strong> +10</p>\n  <p><strong>Discovery</strong> @Check[sandpoint-lore|dc:18], @Check[perception|dc:20], @Check[society|dc:22]</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Influence Skills</strong> @Check[sandpoint-lore|dc:18] (to chat and reminisce about the past), @Check[performance|dc:20] (to compare interpretations about plays and operas they’ve seen or would like to\n    see), @Check[deception|dc:20], @Check[diplomacy|dc:24] or @Check[intimidation|dc:20]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Influence 2</strong> Something about the PCs rekindles in Arika the idea that an adventuring party need not\n    be dysfunctional.

Tailor Arika’s story of her adventures such that what she tells the PCs about the Pit,\n    for the most part, simply covers areas they’ve already explored, but the end of her tale comes when the rest of the\n    group decided they were ready to delve below the fog line within the Pit and descended nearly a hundred feet down\n    the slick ledges, only to be attacked by the Sandpoint Devil. Arika admits she never saw the devil, but the state it\n    left her good friend Olsemper in scarred her. She glosses over her frantic escape from the Pit, bitterly noting that\n    she managed to get away only because the Sandpoint Devil was distracted as it ate her friends’ bodies. She pauses\n    here, then pulls out a strand of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.KrmSuQIyu6OEi5ew]{Holy Prayer Beads}</em> and regards them a moment before handing the strand to the PCs.\n    She explains it once belonged to Olsemper, but keeping it only brings back bad memories, and perhaps, she reasons,\n    it will bring the PCs more luck in the Pit than she had. If the PCs refuse her gift, she blushes with a mix of shame\n    and anger, then excuses herself from the table to seek out solitude. Whether or not a PC can apologize to her and\n    receive the beads thereafter is left to you to decide.\n  </p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>\n    <strong>Resistances</strong> Arika dislikes having her choices critiqued or second-guessed. If she gets the feeling\n    that a PC doesn’t approve of the company she keeps (even though she might agree with them, deep down), she only\n    answers in curt replies to their attempts at conversation. This increases all Influence DCs for that PC by 2.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Weaknesses</strong> Arika has grown unhappy with the adventuring lifestyle overall, and a PC who tells her\n    that her mother misses her and would welcome her back makes her realize she still has an option for a life here\n    —once she finishes one last job for Kaleb. Still, this act of compassion grants the entire party a +2 circumstance\n    bonus on all future Influence checks against her.\n  </p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>\n    <strong>Background</strong> The sight of adventurers saving Sandpoint multiple times during her childhood made an\n    impression on Arika, and as soon as she came of age, she left her mother’s shop to seek adventure herself. Her first\n    group explored the Pit, but quickly got in over their heads—she was the only survivor from a harrowing attack in the\n    fog by the Sandpoint Devil (she never actually saw the monster, but certainly saw what it had done to her\n    companions). Rebelling further against her mother’s observations about how adventuring was the wrong choice, she\n    made another bad decision when she fell in with this current group of criminals. With the right friendly support and\n    advice, she might be steered away from these self-destructive habits, but left to her own decisions, Arika will be\n    lucky to live another year. She’s become quite enamored with somber dirges and funeral marches of late—her skill at\n    haunting violin music is only growing.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Appearance</strong> Arika has dark hair dyed red, dark brown eyes, and pale skin. She wears practical\n    clothing in dark colors and has a somewhat sad air about her—even if she smiles, it doesn’t reach her eyes.\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>Personality</strong> gloomy, sarcastic, secretly wistful</p>\n</section>\n<p>\n  When the dinner ends, Kaleb and the rest thank the PCs for a delightful time, then wish them luck on their future\n  adventures before they split up for the night. If the PCs attempt to follow any of them, Arika’s staying in a room\n  here at the Rusty Dragon (after a fight with her mother, she’s not eager to return home), Chertus heads to @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11thepixieskit00]{The Pixie’s Kitten} for a night of companionship (only to be turned away at the door, after which he goes to sulk at @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11thefeedbag0000]{The Feedbag}\n  for the rest of the night), Adimar returns to his uncle’s @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11scarnettiman00]{Estate} up on the bluff, and Kaleb makes his way on an\n  ambling walk through the streets to the north before dipping into an alley. Once he feels he’s out of sight, he casts\n  <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.VlNcjmYyu95vOUe8]</em> to teleport to the basement of his boarded up manor south of town. This adventure assumes the\n  PCs lose track of the other adventurers—if they’re too distracted and seem to be obsessing over them, consider having\n  Vodger Magravi contact them in the next event to give the rivals some time to slip away.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Eventually Kaleb sends the three adventurers into the Pit with orders to Adimar (the only one he really trusts) to\n  prepare an ambush for the PCs. These plans don’t go quite as well as intended, as detailed in @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20007apatte]{Chapter 7}.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Reward:</strong> Grant the PCs 10 XP for each NPC they reach 2 Influence with, or 20 XP for each NPC they\n  reach 4 Influence with.\n</p>"

Vodger Magravi, a server at\n  Risa’s Place (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11risasplace0000]{13} on the Sandpoint map), asks the PCs to visit the tavern early one morning\n  before the establishment opens for the day (or alternatively, requests their aid during a visit they might pay to the\n  tavern). Things have been strained at Risa’s Place since the recent death of the matriarch who established the tavern,\n  but now they’re getting worse. Vodger’s older sister, Lanalee, has been having frightening nightmares involving\n  something about the family’s dead mother, and he hopes the PCs can help—either by soothing Lanalee’s worries or by\n  discovering if there’s something more to her nightmares.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lanalee is somewhat embarrassed by her dreams, and is both frustrated and annoyed at Vodger when he introduces the PCs\n  to her and says that they’re here to help. Traditionally the most responsible of the Magravi siblings, Lanalee has\n  been stubbornly ignoring her unsettling dreams to focus on running the tavern, but at one glance, a PC can tell she’s\n  not had much sleep of late. The PCs must earn Lanalee’s trust by adjusting her initial attitude of indifferent to at\n  least friendly (or optionally earn the support of Risa’s Place), at which time she sighs and admits that she’s been\n  having unsettling dreams lately. In these dreams, Lanalee is looking for her mother. The location of the dream varies,\n  but every time she finds her mother, she’s got her back to her and is milking a cow, of all things. Lanalee calls out\n  to her, and the cow looks back to her and says, in her mother’s voice, “They wear us when we dream!” A moment later,\n  her mother stands and slowly starts to turn to face her, knocking over the milk bucket as she does. Instead of milk,\n  hundreds of tiny woodlice scuttle out of the pail. As her mother turns, her body begins to shift and bulge, splitting\n  open from the back of her skull down to her shoulder blades to let something out along with the noxious stench of\n  rancid milk, but Lanalee always wakes with a scream just before she can clearly see what it was that was wearing her\n  mother’s body.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lanalee tells the PCs that her mother claimed to be able to travel to other worlds when she dreamed, and she believes\n  her dreams are warnings from her mother—she’s even started to believe that she’s somehow still alive, but trapped\n  somewhere. Should they ask, she allows a PC to examine her aura or otherwise use magic to try to determine whether\n  she’s been cursed, is haunted, or is otherwise suffering from a magical affliction. She’s not, and the PCs’\n  investigations should confirm this (either with a @Check[medicine|dc:22] check, or another relevant skill or spell).\n</p>\n<p>\n  These dreams are not warnings sent by Lanalee’s mother, but her own latent powers as a dreamer warning her about the\n  hidden agenda of the Midnight Dawn. There’s not much to be done about the dreams at this moment other than to try to\n  soothe Lanalee’s fears, which a PC can achieve with a @Check[diplomacy|dc:20] check made after 10 minutes of gentle\n  conversation. Alternatively, a @Check[deception|dc:22|traits:action:lie,auditory,concentrate,linguistic,mental,secret|name:Lie] check to Lie to her and convince her the dreams are harmless soothes\n  her.

Canny players may recognize some of the symbols\n  early, but at this time, there’s not much they can do about it. If your players come up with a particularly clever or\n  interesting insight from the dream and seek out Aliver, see the end of @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20005shadow]{Chapter 5} for details on how to handle an early\n  confrontation with the poisoner.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Reward:</strong> For hearing Lanalee’s dream, grant the PCs 20 XP.

The killing spree culminated\n  with the slaughter of the town’s sheriff (Casp Avertin, father to Arika Avertin), after which the remaining town\n  guards, led by Belor Hemlock, trapped Stoot in his ramshackle shack atop the small outcropping just north of the Old\n  Light.

But before he could release Stoot’s ghost back into\n  the town, he needed to be confident that a suitable group of pawns was nearing the point where he could influence them\n  into destroying Sazzleru’s ward at the bottom of the Pit. As the PCs reach 9th level, that time has finally come.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Red Bishop, ever the showman, even has the perfect agent lined up to serve as Stoot’s first victim—a man who’s\n  been a foil for the PCs from the start of this campaign: Charn Scarnetti.

The very real dangers of\n  the Pit that garner its notoriety are also the primary reason for the high turnover of goblin clans here as well, with\n  misadventures, monsters, and gravity serving as highly effective methods to keep goblin clans from growing too large\n  or lasting too long once they settle within.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The current goblin clan, the Whistlefangs, are on their way out. As recently as two years ago, they controlled the\n  majority of the above-fog levels within the Pit, but an alliance gone sour with two bickering caligni bands, followed\n  up by the disastrous arrival of the Devil’s Disciples, has seen the Whistlefangs reduced to a fraction of their\n  original number. Now limited to a portion of the uppermost level where they clash frequently against infestations of\n  gremlins and other creatures, the Whistlefangs were ready to abandon their home and beg for the Birdcrunchers to the\n  west to take them in when a miracle arrived: an undead miracle clad in fiery armor named Ripnugget.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Whistlefangs are a particularly obscure and sadistic gathering of goblins, a group the other local clans either\n  prefer not to mention (other than to trade scary stories of Whistlefang devil worship) or simply forget about\n  entirely. The Whistlefangs are so called for their practice of drilling holes in their teeth, allowing them to create\n  a wide range of whistling cries that they use to communicate quickly and discreetly. As the PCs explore this level,\n  the Whistlefangs use these sounds to coordinate the defense of the lair. The whistles are more akin to a set of\n  complex signals rather than an actual language, but if the PCs secure a Whistlefang goblin’s cooperation, they might\n  be able to learn some of these whistles so they can intercept messages or even attempt to Lie using these signals.\n  Attempts to do so take a –2 circumstance penalty to Deception, as these whistles are difficult to fake by people who\n  don’t have holes drilled into their teeth. A cooperative Whistlefang might be able to provide additional information\n  about their old lair, now controlled by the Devil’s Disciples—see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20004footpr]{Chapter 4} for more details.\n</p>"

              "text": "<h1 class=\"no-toc\">Shrine of the Sandpoint Devil</h1>\n<p>\n  The notorious Sandpoint Devil is well known to those who live on the Lost Coast, with stories of its sightings, cattle\n  mutilating attacks, or the tragedies it’s said to visit upon travelers on lonely roads or on those who don’t protect\n  their homes during nights when it’s believed to be on the hunt being among the most popular folktales told from\n  Magnimar to Roderic’s Cove. So obscure and elusive is the mysterious Sandpoint Devil that some don’t believe it exists\n  at all. They point to the irrefutable fact that so many other flying monsters exist and are documented, but no such\n  hard evidence of the Sandpoint Devil seems available. For others, though, the Sandpoint Devil is more than real—it is\n  a matter of religious certainty.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Whistlefangs are one such cult—goblins who came to live in the Pit out of fearful respect of a creature they\n  worship as a god. They converted and decorated several chambers on this level of the Pit and transformed the rooms\n  into places sacred to the Sandpoint Devil, known also to the goblins as “He Whose Breath is Death” or as the\n  “Smoke-Mouthed Father.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  To the Devil’s Disciples, the Sandpoint Devil is no god, but it remains a subject of religious obsession. This cult\n  began when a bard named Jordus Munt passed through @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11adoomedtown000#sandpointsettlement-4]{Sandpoint} and spent an evening at the Hagfish, listening quietly to\n  the storytelling contest known as Yarnings that periodically takes place therein. A story took hold in Jordus’s mind\n  about how the Sandpoint Devil was the child of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.aipkJQxP4GBsTaGq]{Lamashtu} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.IZcdF1G8ZsnMotaM]{Pazuzu}, and that once it consumes 66 souls, it will\n  transform into a god of fire, rebirth, and ruin. While the tale was a complete fabrication, it worked its magic on\n  Jordus and he left Sandpoint, returning home to Korvosa the next day and spending the next few years researching the\n  Sandpoint Devil. During this time, Jordus fell into a deep well of confirmation bias and conspiracy theories, and\n  eventually he convinced himself that not only were the legends true, but the Sandpoint Devil was a mere 11 innocent\n  souls away from reaching its goal.\n</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar float-right\">\n  <h1>Whistlefang Aid</h1>\n  <p>\n    Since the Whistlefangs once lived on this level, a cooperative goblin can tell the PCs a fair amount about the\n    place, although their information isn’t as detailed as the PCs might like.

Chief among these initial believers was a zealous halfling sorcerer named\n  Asmerelli, who became convinced that her diabolic bloodline stemmed from the Sandpoint Devil itself. In time, Jordus,\n  Asmerelli, and several devout cultists they’d recruited made their way across Varisia to the Sandpoint Hinterlands.\n  They came to the Pit, but did not deem themselves worthy of descending to its depths to face the Sandpoint Devil in\n  person. Instead, they explored its upper levels and discovered the Whistlefangs. Equal parts scandalized by how the\n  goblins worshipped the object of their own obsession so crudely and delighted to find proof that its presence\n  instilled faith in others beyond themselves, Jordus Munt presented himself to the goblins as a pilgrim of the\n  “Smoke-Mouthed Father” and ingratiated his cult into their numbers—only to betray the goblins and seize control of\n  their temple. Forced to retreat (in greatly lessened numbers) to the upper works of their lair, the Whistlefangs never\n  quite recovered enough to reclaim their lost home.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since then, the Devil’s Disciples have made themselves at home in the Shrine of the Sandpoint Devil, and while there\n  are still areas of this level they haven’t discovered, they control the majority of it. Since their arrival, Jordus\n  Munt has carefully orchestrated the abduction and sacrifice of several unfortunates that his extensive research has\n  indicated fit the right profile to satiate his nascent god’s hunger. While the cult is only a few victims away from\n  reaching what they believe will be the final sacrifice, their actions have in fact roused the Sandpoint Devil from an\n  extensive period of slumber. As the PCs begin to explore this level, the Sandpoint Devil returns to its nightly hunts\n  for the first time in years, and sightings of it begin to spread, culminating in a terrifying attack on the town (see\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20004footpr.JournalEntryPage.04theseconddoo00]{The Second Doom} at the end of this chapter).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Jordus Munt is not to be found here at this time—he’s left the cult in the hands of his second in command, Asmerelli,\n  while he travels deeper into the Pit to be closer to the source of his convictions. The PCs will confront him in time,\n  after the initial threat of the Sandpoint Devil has passed. See @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20006torais]{Chapter 6} for more details.\n</p>"

The mural depicts a\n    sweeping view of a coastline as seen from a rocky plateau. At the center of the plateau is a large pit from which\n    the smoky form of what appears to be a winged, burning horse with a dragon’s tail is rising. Dozens of small\n    handprints decorate the walls near the floor, surrounding the image of the pit with what must be dried blood. Large\n    wooden double doors, each painted with images of the same winged creature, stand to the north and south of the room,\n    while a smaller door to the north bears no decoration at all.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The only furnishing in the otherwise empty room is a low wooden platform on the floor in the northern part of the\n    chamber. It is entirely surrounded by low railing and two wooden statues stand atop it—one of the same strange\n    monster and the other of a man kneeling down before it in a position of worship.\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  The image depicted on the mural is easily recognizable as a view of the Lost Coast, as seen from the vantage point of\n  the Pit. Painted with surprising skill by now-dead Whistlefang artisans, the Devil’s Disciples were astounded by the\n  mural when they first arrived and often spend time meditating before it—but the first time the PCs arrive here, the\n  room is empty save for the unusual group of guardian creatures that watch over the chamber.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Creatures:</strong> The position of the 5-by-10-foot long platform, as well as the two wooden statues, is\n  indicated on the map by the dotted rectangle. In truth, the statues and platform combined are actually two adjacent\n  mimics with particularly artistic mindsets that were first befriended by the Whistlefangs and then by the Devil’s\n  Disciples, both of whom admire their talent as well as the free protection they afford the temple entrance. The mimics\n  themselves enjoy appearing as these statues, for it allows them to revel in the worship that those who venerate the\n  Sandpoint Devil pay them in passing. That the worship isn’t actually directed at the mimics is irrelevant to their\n  alien mindsets.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The mimics themselves aren’t the only guardians either, for the “platform” that is their base covers a narrow trough\n  in the floor where the Whistlefangs kept one of their more cantankerous pets—a brightly colored black and red striped\n  amphisbaena. As long as the two-headed snake is kept fed, it’s content to sleep in the hollow space below the mimics,\n  both of which understand its value as an additional guard and leave it alone.\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    <img style=\"transform:scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/tokens/Amphisbaena.webp\" />\n    <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">The Devil's Doorstep</span>\n      <span class=\"keepme\">Low 6</span>\n    </h2>\n    <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.GRHSDD6fQGazyGFW]{Mimics (2)} @UUID[Actor.QvegyCW7CfRUTbjp]{Amphisbaena}</span>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    All three guardians recognize intruders, though. The mimics remain motionless until someone attempts to touch or\n    climb\n    onto the platform, or until the PCs pay the platform no mind and move further into the room, whereupon they flow\n    apart\n    and attack, slithering into squares adjacent to the trough. This exposes the amphisbaena, which rises up with angry\n    dual hissing to attack as well.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If the PCs kill one of the mimics, the other realizes the seriousness of the situation and retreats to a far corner\n    of\n    the room until the amphisbaena (which fights to the death) is killed. They fight to the death as well to defend\n    themself, but beg for mercy from the PCs first, promising to turn into a statue to celebrate their glory if they\n    just\n    leave them alone. The mimic doesn’t know much about the rest of this dungeon, but they can describe to the PCs how\n    both the Whistlefangs and the Devil’s Disciples kept them fed and amused them with regular adorations. They attempt\n    to\n    escape out onto Devil’s Platter at the first opportunity that presents itself—they certainly won’t join forces with\n    the PCs, but can warn them that an extra big cultist with a large hook stands guard beyond the southern doors.\n  </p>\n</section>"

Ooun’s Prison</span><span>Low 6</span></h2>\n<p>This room is completely dark.</p>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">\n  The air in this cave is noticeably cooler than elsewhere, and a strange, inky condensation beads on the wall, seeming\n  stubbornly unwilling to drip down to the floor. A large, cracked slab of black stone protrudes from the cave’s floor\n  to the south, looking almost as if it had slowly erupted from the surrounding rock like a stony tumor.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Creature:</strong> This room was once a secret shrine—a place only the goblin witch Minargul knew about and\n  about which none of the Devil’s Disciples yet know. It was in this chamber, many years ago, where Minargul first heard\n  the voice of her mysterious patron—the source of her worship of the Sandpoint Devil. This “voice” calls out\n  telepathically to the PCs as they approach, asking in Abyssal, “And who might these fine bodies be who come to visit\n  me? Where is my darling pet Minargul?”\n</p>\n<p>\n  The voice belongs to an invidiak demon named Ooun, who has been imprisoned in this slab of stone since the era of old\n  Thassilon, bound here by Liralarue to occasionally serve as an advisor. Having been imprisoned for so long, Ooun does\n  not speak Common—the only languages the demon can speak are Abyssal and Thassilonian. Minargul was the first living\n  creature he encountered in all those years, and he was eager to speak to someone after all that time, having long\n  since forgotten who imprisoned him and why. Ooun tried to get Minargul to touch the stone in which he is imprisoned,\n  but in her superstitious awe, she never dared do so—much to the demon’s frustration. With little recourse but to wait,\n  he amused himself by playing upon her beliefs, and on noticing her faith, he pretended to be the voice of the\n  Sandpoint Devil.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ooun doesn’t really miss Minargul and cackles in delight if the PCs inform him that the goblin witch is dead. He then\n  tries to convince a PC to touch the stone, promising treasures, great power, and visions of glory if they do so.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of course, this is a trap, for anyone who touches the stone exposes themself to the demon’s influence. Ooun can\n  attempt to cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.wU6hNzK8Yfqdmc8m]{Possession} on a creature that touches the\n  stone, but as he does so through the magic that imprisons\n  him, the save DC of the spell is reduced to DC 22. If Ooun fails to possess a creature, he curses and rages (he can\n  only make such an attempt once a day, and he knows he may need to wait another thousand years or more for his next\n  chance), but can do little more.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If Ooun successfully possesses a PC, the demon immediately goes silent. The beads of “ink”—actually congealed\n  shadows—suddenly drip down the walls and evaporate, and the temperature in the cave returns to normal. Ooun isn’t\n  eager to expose himself and remains a quiet “hitchhiker” in the possessed PC, allowing them to continue acting as\n  normal. Unless Ooun is detected earlier, he remains in hiding until the PCs return to Sandpoint, at which time the\n  demon releases his host while they sleep and slinks off into the city to hunt. In this event, Ooun possesses someone\n  in town whom he saw the PCs were friendly with, then uses that victim to try to kill the PCs, delighting in the mayhem\n  and their feelings of betrayal. Ooun prefers not to work this evil through the PCs themselves, but rather to use lower\n  level, “harmless” victims to make his actions all the more awful. Ooun’s favored hosts are humans.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If Ooun fails to possess a PC but they can still communicate with him, he tries to convince them to shatter the stone,\n  telling them it is a foul intrusion from the Abyss into this world. Indeed, the stone registers as chaotic and evil\n  (this is, in fact, caused by Ooun’s presence, not by the stone itself) if\n  <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.QnTtGCAvdWRU4spv]{Detect Alignment}</em> is cast.

This event isn’t meant to reduce\n  Sandpoint to ashes, though, so any fires the monster starts during this battle should be ones that the townsfolk can\n  easily contain—provided that the Sandpoint Devil itself can be slain by the PCs. The combat could easily take place in\n  the vicinity of a fire—in this case, the Sandpoint Devil takes advantage of its immunity to fire to vex the PCs,\n  especially if it retreats to an area where a character must enter a burning building or raging inferno to reach it in\n  melee. Such flaming areas are treated as hazardous terrain that inflict [[/r 2d6[fire]]] fire damage to a character\n  whenever they\n  move through it or end their turn in the area of the fires (@Check[reflex|dc:20|basic:true] save).\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    <img style=\"transform:scale(2)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/tokens/Sandpoint%20Devil.webp\" />\n    <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Sandpoint Devil</span>\n      <span class=\"keepme\">Creature 8</span>\n    </h2>\n    <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.OJF43wO0MmIThVxx]{Sandpoint Devil}</span>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    Out of combat, the Sandpoint Devil spends its actions swooping from rooftop to rooftop, either breathing fire on\n    rooftops or using <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.g8QqHpv2CWDwmIm1]{Gust of Wind}</em> to fan flames or\n    blow embers toward non-burning buildings. Once the PCs\n    attack, however, the creature recognizes them as threats and focuses on them. It starts this fight by unleashing the\n    Devil’s Howl, which causes any NPCs in the area to flee in panic. Its next action in combat is to use\n    <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.tlcrVRqW1MSKJ5IC]{Phantasmal Killer}</em> against a PC. When you describe\n    this illusory threat, though, it doesn’t manifest as the\n    most fearsome creature the target can imagine.

If it does escape, you should absolutely have the PCs face it\n    again at some point, perhaps as they are navigating the ledges within the pit.

In particular, Liralarue was fascinated by the rumors that Sorshen\n  had created numerous clones of herself and hid them in remote locations throughout all Thassilon, so that were she to\n  die, her consciousness would simply be reborn in one of many spare bodies lying in wait in those hidden vaults. In\n  particular, Liralarue was intrigued by how Runelord Sorshen, as a practitioner of lust magic, could master such a\n  powerful necromantic ritual as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.pZr1xrCpaSu6qrXU]{Clone}</em>, for that school of magic was one forbidden by those who pursued the\n  study of enchantment magic in that era. Eventually, this line of thought would lead to Liralarue’s greatest epiphany\n  about the nature of Thassilonian magic, but here in the Cloneworks, her studies and investigation focused primarily\n  upon the <em>clone</em> ritual itself—how it worked, how it could be used to create duplicates of important political\n  figures she could control, and how to enhance and streamline the ritual to make it less prohibitive to perform. As the\n  ritual itself was theoretically not beyond Liralarue’s ability to actually perform, she struggled with learning the\n  ritual and never quite mastered it before Earthfall brought an end to her plans, so the Cloneworks were never put to\n  full use.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After Earthfall and Liralarue’s mysterious disappearance, the apprentices she kept here as researchers abandoned the\n  Cloneworks, and for thousands of years, the chambers remained abandoned.

The zoogs\n      aren’t\n      quite sure how they managed to get here and don’t know how to return home—and perhaps more frustratingly, they’ve\n      lost\n      the scent of the midnight milk now that they’re in the waking realm.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As soon as the swarm notices the PCs, the creatures begin hissing, chattering, and squealing in excitement,\n      clinging\n      in sheets to the walls of fungus in the cavern.

When the swarm speaks, they do so in a disconcerting way, with each word spoken from a\n      different individual zoog, but timed to a cadence that sounds almost like it comes from a single source. They\n      demand\n      to know if it was the PCs’ dreams that lured them from their beloved woodland in the Dimension of Dreams, or if\n      not,\n      whose dreams they might have been. The zoogs describe the dreams as a series of phantasmagorical images of an\n      immense\n      city sprawled in a vast cavern or canyon, of curving spirals of streets winding through steepled buildings and\n      shining\n      towers, of the sound of strange music and delighted laughter echoing through vast halls, of a sunless ocean shore\n      lapping against stone piers, and of overwhelming sensations of bliss and delight. But it was the “scent” of the\n      dream\n      that drew them here, an odor the zoogs describe as the “smell of cherished memories” cut with the “scent of\n      unfulfilled hope.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A successful @Check[occultism|dc:28|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge]\n      check to Recall Knowledge is enough for a PC to recognize the description as perhaps\n      referring to the mysterious and legendary lost city of Ilvarandin—a paradise believed to be hidden (depending on\n      the\n      legend) in a remote mountain vale, nestled in the depths of an unknown canyon, or deep underground in an immense\n      cavern. A critical success allows a PC to recall more disturbing rumors that Ilvarandin is a city of falsehoods\n      inhabited by mysterious shapechanging creatures. A critical failure leaves the PC convinced the dream is of one of\n      the\n      seven cities ruled by the runelords of Thassilon in ancient times.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The zoogs ask the PCs to bring them the dream so they may return home—or barring the dream, to bring them one who\n      has\n      dreamed of the city. As payment for the service, they promise to leave behind one of their greatest treasures for\n      the\n      PCs when they return home. If the PCs bring the zoog swarm a dose of midnight milk, one of the creatures quickly\n      drinks the drug and, rather than suffer its normal effects alone, these effects quickly spread through the entire\n      swarm, causing them to sigh and groan in delight for a few moments before they fade away back through the boundary\n      of\n      sleep to return to the Dreamlands. Alternatively, if they bring a person who’s had a dream vision of Ilvarandin,\n      the\n      zoogs demand that person sleep and dream for them at once. If the person agrees, the zoogs gather around them as\n      they\n      lie down and fall into a deep sleep around them—once the dreamer’s dreams begin, the zoogs use that energy to\n      travel\n      back home as well. Having their dreams used as a catalyst like this leaves the dreaming creature potentially\n      filled\n      with melancholy and regret upon waking at not having been able to travel with the zoogs.

The notes imply that Aliver\n  “prepared” these elves for Kanker, but do not detail who or what Kanker is, or exactly how the “preparations” were\n  performed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Finally, several entries near the back of the documents indicate that Aliver has recently secured an agreement with a\n  group called the Midnight Dawn to aid in their “dream experiments.” Little more information is forthcoming, other than\n  to note that none other than “K. Valdemar” is Aliver’s primary point of contact with the group.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the PCs capture Aliver alive, they (or agents of the Town Watch) might be able to learn more from him, but not too\n  much more. Aliver knows that Kaleb Valdemar is part of the Midnight Dawn but believes they’re just some sort of new\n  “drug gang from Magnimar.” If asked about Kanker, he grows fearful and quiet—just how much about the ghast he might\n  reveal to the PCs is up to you, but try to err on the side of “mysterious and unnerving.” Aliver knows a little bit\n  about the layout of the Cloneworks (areas @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20005shadow.JournalEntryPage.05deroambush0000]{F2},\n  the northern part of @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20005shadow.JournalEntryPage.05lakeofthehol00]{F20}, and area\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20005shadow.JournalEntryPage.05templeofazat00]{F17}), and even less about the level below. If\n  the PCs seem focused on trying to learn as much as they\n  can about the Pit from Aliver, the Midnight Dawn might just send an intellect devourer from area\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20006torais.JournalEntryPage.06midnightdawn00]{G7} into town one night to kill him.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In any event, Kaleb Valdemar has already relocated to the Pit at this point, so once the PCs learn of his connection\n  to the Midnight Dawn, he won’t be around to interrogate—see\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20002strang.JournalEntryPage.02investigatin00]{Investigating Kaleb Valdemar} for more details.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Reward:</strong> If the PCs expose Aliver Podiker and have him arrested, force him to flee into the deeper\n  reaches of the Pit, or simply kill him, they prevent the third of Sandpoint’s seven dooms—grant them 120 XP for the\n  achievement.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While Aliver Podiker wasn’t a well-liked local, he did have allies in town. If the PCs kill him, they lose 1\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11sandpointsfa00]{Reputation Point} with the Bunyip Club. In\n  addition, if the PCs can’t prove that Podiker’s death was the result of\n  self-defense on their part or that the alchemist had ill intent for the town, they’ll lose 5 Reputation Points with\n  the Town Watch and 2 Reputation Points with the Sandpoint Mercantile League and the Townsfolk.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the PCs do manage to expose what Podiker was really up to, though, and can prove it with the documents from\n  Podiker’s basement, they gain 2 Reputation Points with the Sandpoint Mercantile League and the Townsfolk. If they turn\n  Podiker over to the authorities, they also gain 2 Reputation Points with the Town Watch.\n</p>"

A horrific statue stands\n  to the north—a figure vaguely appearing to be a mix of a winged bull standing on its hind feet and a reptilian-headed\n  figure with snakes for legs. Even worse, the statue is sculpted not from stone or wood, but from the flesh of what\n  appear to be at least three humans that have been reshaped and stretched over a creatively reassembled skeleton.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The unsettling statue was, until recently, a trio of Devil’s Disciples who fell victim to the undead guardians of this\n  chamber.

When Earthfall struck, the two priests who had been gathered on site to speak about whether or not they should\n  stay in the area or abandon it were overwhelmed with fear and awe at what they felt to be the end of the world. They\n  made their way back into this chamber from the surface and argued about whether or not their demonic patrons had seen\n  fit to end the world. The argument came to blows, and ultimately the two perished at each other’s hands.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The two zealots, infused with sins that would normally have ensured horrific transformations into demons had they made\n  it to the Abyss, instead lingered here and became totenmaskes.

Upon spotting the PCs, they mistake them\n  for more Devil’s Disciples. One of them steps forward and addresses the PCs in Thassilonian: “And so the infidels\n  return. Tell us, before you join your brothers in our offering to the Abyss, who strikes you as a more appropriate\n  inspiration for a requiem to all that has been lost?

However, this state of mind isn’t distracting enough that she\n    won’t\n    immediately “wake” from her reverie upon noticing any visitors (although she can still be fooled if the PCs are\n    stealthy enough).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If the PCs encounter Yizularun here alone, the fungus tyrant is canny enough to avoid a fight against unknown foes,\n    especially if her telepathic commands to her thrall and followers in area\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20007apatte.JournalEntryPage.07funguscourt000]{H7} go unanswered. While she\n    would love to add the PCs to her moldering empire, she’s just as eager to see that the spores stolen from her domain\n    aren’t allowed to live on. In particular, she rankles at the idea that intruders stole into her domain years ago and\n    made off with some of her fungi. While several of those intruders were slain, enough escaped with stolen spores to\n    annoy her. The prospect of seeking out the thieves herself is below her stature as tyrant of these caverns, of\n    course,\n    and she isn’t comfortable sparing any of her court for the task, but the PCs are another matter. Whether it’s after\n    she turns them into fungal spore thralls, or with a disturbingly sweet request of them when they outnumber her to do\n    her a favor, this “mission” remains the same. She can sense the fungus her stolen spores grew into, somewhere deeper\n    below, and needs the party to destroy every trace of what the spores have grown into. “If they are not to be part of\n    my empire, they do not deserve to be a part of anything,” she reasons. If the PCs agree to do so, they can find her\n    stolen spores growing in the Midnight Dawn fungal farm (area\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20008wherec.JournalEntryPage.08midnightfarm00]{J6}). If they destroy the fungus,\n    Yizularun promises to reward them with the “greatest treasures they’ll ever desire.” Of course, these “treasures”\n    are\n    nothing more than a role as a fungus in her domain, but if canny PCs demand more details before they head off on the\n    mission, she appears flustered. She then indicates some of the treasures heaped within the ring of red-capped\n    mushrooms, implying that the PCs will have their pick of this bounty upon their successful return.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If the PCs do leave on this mission, Yizularun wastes no time trying to recruit new spore thralls to her domain,\n    hoping to have enough allies when the PCs return that she and her thralls can ambush them here—she has no intention\n    of\n    rewarding them with anything other than servitude.

To the south, nestled between a five-foot-diameter and a ten-foot-diameter gear set on opposing\n  walls, four blue metal levers protrude from the wall. Rotating stone pillars covered with smaller gears spin and grind\n  down the room’s centerline.

The constant movement of these various parts fills the room with a\n  grinding cacophony.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This area contains several of the inner workings of the large clockwork engine built into the walls of these chambers\n  and was once a place where the internal components could be serviced.

With the genie’s aid, Zalavexus hoped to imbue the clockworks of this entire complex with\n  a deadly energy that he and Isphinn could use to incapacitate, capture, and potentially even murder his superior,\n  Liralarue. Yet, Liralarue’s mastery over divination gave her the upper hand from the start, and when the duo tried to\n  spring their trap, they realized to their horror that Liralarue had altered their magical workings without them\n  realizing it. Zalavexus was nearly slain and was swiftly captured and entombed in the Wormcrypt (area\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20006torais.JournalEntryPage.06wormcrypt00000]{G12}), while the same energies turned back on\n  Isphinn and bound her into the machinery in this\n  chamber.\n</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar float-right\">\n  <h1>A Friendly Genie?</h1>\n  <p>\n    Unlike most of the ancient creatures found in the Pit, Isphinn still knows and remembers a fair amount about the way\n    things were before Earthfall changed this world, and if the PCs manage to secure her aid, she might tell them more\n    about the Pit, its secrets, and even about Liralarue. Her ability to earth glide could, theoretically, allow her to\n    come and go from the Songbird’s Vault (area\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20007apatte.JournalEntryPage.07songbirdsvau00]{H16}), but she won’t take the risk—she knows\n    about the\n    vault’s existence, but not its exact location, and she doesn’t know what sorts of wards and protections the vault\n    has. She isn’t eager to face more traps left behind by the woman who imprisoned her in a cog.\n  </p>\n</aside>\n<p>\n  For thousands of years, Isphinn remained trapped within these gears, her body reduced and merged with one of countless\n  identical-looking cogs in the machinery, and only when the clockworks were finally wound by the serpentfolk did the\n  imprisoned shaitan have the chance to influence the world around her again. Even then, she remains restricted to this\n  chamber—and as the PCs are, potentially, the first to visit this tomb since Earthfall, they represent her first real\n  chance at freedom.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While she’s trapped, Isphinn can do very little, but while the clockworks are wound (thanks to the serpentfolk), she\n  can exert just enough pressure and influence on the grinding gears she’s a part of to approximate the vague sound of\n  speaking amid the gears—but only in the language of Terran. A PC who doesn’t speak Terran can attempt a\n  @Check[perception|dc:26] check to notice the grinding gears sound almost like language, and with a critical success,\n  the PC\n  identifies the language as Terran. If a PC can understand Terran, they pick out Isphinn’s plea—to “pluck her from this\n  infernal contraption.” She can direct the PCs to the specific tiny cog that she’s lodged within if they can understand\n  her, but if they demand to know more before pulling the cog loose, she reveals she’s a powerful shaitan who was\n  trapped here eons ago, and in return for her freedom, she’ll grant the one who “plucks her free” their fondest desire,\n  greatest hope, or anything else without quite coming out and using the word “wish.” These promises are falsehoods, and\n  a PC who isn’t tricked by Isphinn’s lies and confronts her about it gets her to change her tune. She then promises not\n  only to give the PCs a powerful magical weapon in return, but also promises to tell them about a great treasure horde\n  hidden nearby in a place only the “songs of the gears themselves can open.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  Without her guidance, a PC who spends a half hour Searching the room can attempt a\n  @Check[perception|dc:28|traits:concentrate,exploration,secret,action:search|name:Search] or a\n  @Check[crafting|dc:24|traits:concentrate,exploration,secret,action:search] check to notice that one small cog\n  in the tangle of gears isn’t actually linked to the machine and that it\n  can be pulled free with ease as an Interact action.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a character pulls the cog free, it vanishes and Isphinn appears in its place, a porphyry-skinned, sapphire-haired\n  woman who stands nearly 10 feet tall. Set free, she cackles in delight and relief. Note that while she can now\n  communicate in a language other than Terran, the only other language she knows is Thassilonian. If she tricked the PCs\n  with promises of their fondest desires, she reveals that she has decided to grant them their lives and gives them\n  permission to leave her in peace. If, on the other hand, they convinced her to reveal her secret, Isphinn will tell\n  them that the one-time ruler of this realm kept her treasures in a hidden vault with no physical entrance—and that\n  only the song of a clockwork bird she carried with her could open the golden door to this treasury.\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    <img style=\"transform:scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/tokens/PZO90200%20ISPHINN.webp\" />\n    <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Isphinn's Prison</span>\n      <span class=\"keepme\">Trivial 9</span>\n    </h2>\n    <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.HTH5c8lddM86kcJr]{Isphinn}</span>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    Isphinn’s primary goal once freed is to <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5bTt2CvYHPvaR7QQ]</em> back to the\n    Plane of Earth, but since it requires 10\n    minutes of casting, she won’t begin her escape if the PCs are hostile.

For\n  thousands of years, the temple lay dormant, now and then playing host to creatures from the Darklands, but it wasn’t\n  until a ghast named @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20012advent.JournalEntryPage.12kanker00000000]{Kanker} came to the Pit and\n  discovered the temple that it returned to its original use.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Recently, Kanker struck a bargain with @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20012advent.JournalEntryPage.12theredbishop00]{The Red\n  Bishop} to aid the Midnight Dawn in their plans for\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11adoomedtown000#sandpointsettlement-4]{Sandpoint}.

Thim then asks the PCs if they’ve defeated the guardians of the chamber to the\n  west and wastes no time asking the PCs to help the two of them to escape, as they’ve been too frightened to attempt it\n  on their own. He begs the PCs to escort them out of the temple to safety, be that to the surface or to one of the\n  several tunnels leading deeper into the Darklands.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Pthuminin is lying, and if the PCs fail to see through his deception, he and Vekensvok keep up the charade until a\n  good chance to turn on the party and attack with surprise presents itself, such as when the PCs are attacked by other\n  enemies, are entering a dangerous area, or bed down for the night—but not until they’re far from this area. Before\n  they leave, Pthuminin telepathically informs Tiluatchek, down in area\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20008wherec.JournalEntryPage.08tiluatcheksb00]{J8}, of the development. If\n  Pthuminin and Vekensvok can defeat the PCs, the duo will return here with their bodies as potentially new suits for\n  Tiluatchek to claim.\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    <img style=\"transform:scale(2)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/tokens/Gosreg.webp\" />\n    <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Midnight Farm</span>\n      <span class=\"keepme\">Moderate 10</span>\n    </h2>\n    <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.YCllCQUEV89O6UZS]{Pthuminin} @UUID[Actor.efDvCH10KvXKGTZq]{Vekensvok}\n      @UUID[Actor.K7hvZokBDqu61Sws]{Vekensvok's Lampad}</span>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    If the PCs see through the deception, the duo instead attacks the party here, hoping to take advantage of the spores\n    in the air but wary of damaging the fungus too much.

Still clad in\n  Kaleb’s corpse, the canny intellect devourer readies\n  himself for a final deception.

He then\n  casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.R9xqCBblkS5KE4y7]{Sending}</em> to warn Kanker about the PCs—if the\n  PCs have already slain the ghast, Tiluatchek’s failure to\n  deliver the message only proves to him how dangerous the PCs are and how important it is to defeat them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When the PCs enter, Kaleb lurches up from the bed in an apparently drugged state and desperately begs the party to\n  save him, spinning a tale about his abduction by a hideous, shape-changing creature. Kaleb claims to have been\n  imprisoned here, dosed on drugs that inhibit his spellcasting and unable to escape through the locked door. He\n  desperately wants to be escorted back to Sandpoint. If the PCs confront him about earlier encounters with his\n  mercenaries on the level above, Kaleb apologizes and “reveals” he recently fired the group after realizing they had\n  nefarious plans for the PCs. He’d intended to warn the PCs but was abducted by the shape-changing monster before he\n  could—he’ll attempt to connect his mercenaries with this creature if he thinks that false conspiracy will help to sell\n  his story.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Tiluatchek will let the PCs escort him all the way back to Sandpoint if the PCs fall for his story, then once they’re\n  safe and alone, he plots an attack on the party that night. He hopes to catch one of the PCs unaware as the party\n  sleeps in an attempt to steal a PC’s body and infiltrate the group, luring each character out alone one after the\n  other until the PCs are all dead and added to his skin-suit collection.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The fact that the PCs have likely heard conflicting stories from his mercenaries, or that his tactics closely mimic\n  those of his allies in area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20008wherec.JournalEntryPage.08midnightfarm00]{J6}, likely makes\n  it a bit more difficult for him to spin a believable\n  yarn. If the players seem suspicious, particularly if the characters point out these contradictions or previously\n  encountered tactics, Tiluatchek takes a –4 circumstance penalty to his Deception checks to Lie.

If he succeeds, he tries to\n  play off the PC’s sudden strange behavior by claiming the character is being controlled by the creatures who captured\n  him while he moves toward the exit, intending to slip out of the room and lock the PCs in before he makes his way to\n  area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20008wherec.JournalEntryPage.08kankerslabor00]{J12}.\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n  <img style=\"transform:scale(1)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/mm_logo_blue.svg\" alt=\"MetaMorphic Digital Studio\" title=\"MetaMorphic Digital Studio\" />\n  <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Music Notes</span><span class=\"keepme\">Music</span></h2>\n  <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Playlist.TmV0uKHOhpcz4zGF.PlaylistSound.DIMtNU82kxB8i85Z]{Puppetry}</span>\n  </div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    <img style=\"transform:scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/tokens/Tiluatchek.webp\" />\n    <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Tiluatchek's Boudoir</span>\n      <span class=\"keepme\">Moderate 10</span>\n    </h2>\n    <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.CILo525fbQw8b4W4]{Tiluatchek} @UUID[Actor.ecqOHEl8XRfXrQUj]{Kaleb Valdemar’s\n      Body}</span>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    If a fight begins, Tiluatchek moves about as best he can to avoid being caught in melee, favoring spells that hinder\n    tactical options.

The last third of the journal is written in a much\n  more baroque hand—Tiluatchek wrote these words, which are more a collection of interesting sensations he’s experienced\n  as Kaleb: fine foods, unusual smells, pains and pleasures of the flesh, and the like. Later entries describe his\n  thoughts on the PCs as well as the food he shared at the Rusty Dragon. The journal’s final pages contain a list of\n  frustrated notes at how the PCs have disrupted Tiluatchek’s plans as they involved Aliver Podiker and conclude with a\n  list of Sandpoint’s movers and shakers (PCs included)—all targets that Tiluatchek plans to soon dose on midnight milk\n  and then use to take over the town from within.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Several folded sheets of parchment tucked into the back of this journal contain the formulas for\n  <em>demortification oil</em>\n  and refined midnight milk.

This thinness made one of her earliest triumphs possible: the conjuration and entrapment of a\n  glabrezu demon. Using a sacred sword stolen from a priest of the empyreal lord Smiad as a focus, Liralarue bound the\n  glabrezu into this chamber, and she visited often for advice and aid (that she typically had to bully or beat this\n  assistance out of the glabrezu was no concern for the cruel wizard).\n</p>\n<p>\n  For a few thousand years after Earthfall, the glabrezu enjoyed the relative peace and quiet resulting from Liralarue’s\n  departure, yet every attempt to leave failed as long as the sacred sword remained in place. Unable to touch or\n  directly affect the weapon, the glabrezu remained here longer and longer as she nursed her frustration and hatred. At\n  some point between Earthfall and the modern era, she took to calling herself Liralarue and using\n  <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.i35dpZFI7jZcRoBo]{Illusory Disguise}</em> to make herself appear to be the\n  long departed wizard. Today, the glabrezu maintains this\n  <em>illusory disguise</em> at all times, and after\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20012advent.JournalEntryPage.12kanker00000000]{Kanker} arrived, many years passed before he\n  realized the truth. The\n  ghast never fell for “Liralarue’s” lies and, much as the real Liralarue did in times past, uses the glabrezu as a\n  research assistant now and then as needed, having come to see the trapped demon as a gift placed here by Kabriri.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When the PCs enter the room, the glabrezu stands at the center of the mushroom-covered island, appearing very much as\n  a living and breathing Liralarue. She calls out to the PCs as soon as she notices them, using\n  <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.SwUiVavHKMWG7t5K]</em> to\n  speak Common and claiming to be none other than “Runelord Liralarue, the Eighth of the Seven.” The glabrezu’s\n  responses to the PCs’ questions are mostly falsehoods—have fun making things up as answers to cause confusion, but it\n  won’t take long before Liralarue indicates the sword impaling the ancient skeleton behind her. She claims that the\n  weapon was once wielded by a heroine who attempted to slay her eons ago, but when Liralarue turned the tables on her\n  and used telekinetic magic to impale the hero on her own blade, the gods themselves were affronted and cursed her to\n  live forever in this cavern until “one pure of heart would come to claim the great blade as their own.” She tries to\n  get the PCs to pull the blade free—the fact that the sword does radiate good and bears elements that mark it as sacred\n  to the worship of an empyreal lord lends strength to the lies—but if the sword is claimed, the ancient magic keeping\n  Liralarue in place vanishes.\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    <img style=\"transform:scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/tokens/Liralarue.webp\" />\n    <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Inner Sanctum</span>\n      <span class=\"keepme\">Severe 10</span>\n    </h2>\n    <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.sYm0DmnCzZ3xZlZP]{Liralarue} @UUID[Actor.kezJnTKAyVhKZctD]{Corpselight Mist}</span>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    In this case, Liralarue cackles in delight and assumes her true form, then offers the PC who claimed the sword a\n    <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.VlNcjmYyu95vOUe8]</em>.

The\n    key element that seems to be keeping him from enacting any of these plans is the simple fact that, while Kanker is\n    sure he can take Sandpoint, he doesn’t know how to keep it, and he understands that it would likely only be a matter\n    of months before forces from Magnimar arrive in town to wipe him out and retake the town.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Kanker has entered an alliance with someone he calls the “Red Bishop.” The journals don’t indicate what this Red\n    Bishop is, other than to reveal that Kanker is both respectful and fearful of the Red Bishop’s power. In return for\n    aiding the Midnight Dawn in their plot, the Red Bishop has promised to help Kanker secure a lasting rule over\n    Sandpoint, centered on a promise to teach him how to activate and use an ancient Thassilonian weapon that’s still\n    functional in the town, tied to the Old Light.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The Red Bishop has claimed the isle known as Grubber’s Hermitage, not quite 3 miles due west of Sandpoint, as his\n    lair. The Red Bishop entrusted both Kanker and Tiluatchek with the secret to activating a portal between\n    Tiluatchek’s Boudoir (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20008wherec.JournalEntryPage.08tiluatcheksb00]{J8}) and the isle,\n    but Kanker’s note might be confusing. It says only\n    that to activate the portal, one must speak aloud “the false stanza from Vumeshki’s masterpiece” while standing on\n    the stone platform in the boudoir.

The four vrocks have been spending their time since perched on the stone walls of area\n  <strong>L6</strong> at the four compass points, telepathically pontificating on the philosophical implications and\n  plausibilities of the Red Bishop’s schemes and making their own plans for the PCs once the Red Bishop is through with\n  them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Upon spotting the PCs, the vrocks call out to them in Common, welcoming them to “the Red Bishop’s kingdom” and\n  obsequiously congratulating them on their “grand success within the Pit.” They’ll inform the PCs that “the Red Bishop\n  awaits with a special task to the west, under the broken wings of the false lord of air” (a reference to the fallen\n  temple of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.YXmeBdOZfWgUljW1]{Ylimancha} at area\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20009thered.JournalEntryPage.09nfallenchurc00]{N}).

The original founders envisioned dozens of these temples all along the Lost\n  Coast to provide seafaring support, but this was the only structure completed. Unfortunately, the church was attacked\n  not long after it was finished, and its priests were slaughtered by a raiding party of ulat-kinis led by an alghollthu\n  that took offense at the presence of a house of worship so close to one of its underwater lairs.

He proposes that he teach the PCs a ritual they can perform in the\n  Pit to bolster the ward, noting that only heroes who carry “the blood of the land” in their veins (those who have\n  generational ties to the region, such as the PCs) can perform the ritual. If the PCs agree, he teaches them this\n  ritual and then urges them to perform it as soon as possible.

If the PCs see through the Red Bishop’s deception, or appear to be hesitant to do\n  this task for the Red Bishop, the mothman does his best to further encourage them. His favorite tactic is to mix the\n  truth with lies. For example, if the PCs accuse him of being a demon worshipper, his reply is to note that “While I do\n  serve Lord @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.IZcdF1G8ZsnMotaM]{Pazuzu}, my home is here, like you—it would be a\n  tragedy to let our differences in faith stand in the way of\n  the Lost Coast’s destiny.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the Red Bishop grows frustrated, his tone changes from diplomacy to something more akin to outright manipulation\n  and emotional blackmail. Especially if the PCs accuse him of being the mastermind behind so many of the other dangers\n  that Sandpoint has recently faced—such as his support of Ripnugget, the Midnight Dawn, or his alliance with Kanker—he\n  imperiously notes that these dangers were nothing the PCs couldn’t conquer, and that he set these “opportunities”\n  before them to cultivate their skills and help hone their power. Without these opportunities, the PCs would never have\n  had a chance to become the heroes they are today—in a way, this makes the Red Bishop a sort of patron or muse to the\n  party, and it would be the height of arrogance and foolishness to turn away from his advice and aid now. He may even\n  liken himself to a parental figure, or even a god to inspire a PC’s whole reason for becoming an adventure if he grows\n  frustrated and impatient enough.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If he feels he can pull it off, he’ll try to trick some or all of PCs into speaking Pazuzu’s name three times during\n  this discussion so he can use True Temptation on them at a later date—although he’s loath to do so, since once a PC\n  succumbs to True Temptation, they become influenced enough by the Abyss that they can no longer successfully perform\n  the rite to remove Sazzleru’s ward.\n</p>"

He accepts surrender at any\n    point, and in return for mercy, he expects the PCs to perform\n    the ritual for him—being bullied into service does not count as being under the Abyss’s influence for purposes of\n    removing the ward. This can give the PCs a chance to bide their time and orchestrate another attack on the Red\n    Bishop\n    in the future, perhaps even in the depths of the Pit, but at this point, since the mothman knows they’re not to be\n    trusted, he and several of his pawns are sure to keep the PCs close at hand and won’t allow them to return to\n    Sandpoint until their task in the Pit is done.\n  </p>\n  <p>Additional details on the Red Bishop’s tactics in combat appear\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20012advent.JournalEntryPage.12theredbishop00]{Here}.</p>\n</section>\n<p>\n  <strong>Reward:</strong> Grant the PCs 120 XP for defeating the Seventh Doom, in addition to the normal XP they’d earn\n  from fighting the Red Bishop and his agents.

Her legacy remains hidden even from the citizens of New Thassilon, for Liralarue was very\n  circumspect about her plans. Could she have managed to create a <em>runewell of vainglory</em>? Might she still live\n  in some hidden demiplane? And if so, how powerful might she have grown in the centuries since the fall of Thassilon?\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Return of Uvaglor:</strong> The demon Uvaglor was born from the Pit many years after Earthfall, yet he has\n  been banished from the Material Plane for centuries more than that. If the PCs are tricked by the Red Bishop into\n  breaking Sazzleru’s ward (see The Ruined Ward), Uvaglor’s return happens more quickly, but if the PCs avoid\n  this manipulation, the knowledge of the powerful demon’s legacy may worry them.

The far side\n  of the portal is, fortunately, in a remote part of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.IZcdF1G8ZsnMotaM]{Pazuzu's} domain of High M’Vania on the Abyss, so at first the\n  invasions from beyond are slow and subtle, with more dangerous demons and deadly influences growing as time passes. Of\n  course, the more immediate concern for the PCs is the fact that removing the ward is likely to draw them into the\n  Abyss, forcing them to navigate a dangerous extraplanar realm if they want to find their way back home. Additional\n  lore about High M’Vania can be found in the Pathfinder First Edition book\n  <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Book of the Damned</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Worm War:</strong> The Midnight Dawn’s goal of using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.thqCdyIkkPUl2N3Y]{Midnight Milk} and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.KBLQtEU6Ya9LT8WW]{Dream Lens} to secure easy access to\n  surface-world bodies is driven by a growing conflict between the Darklands Vaults of Ilvarandin and Denebrum. The\n  latter realm is ruled by neothelids, creatures whose allegiances to abominations from beyond the stars may have\n  repercussions on Sandpoint should seugathi occultists learn of the Midnight Dawn’s plot. Alternatively, the PCs could\n  travel down to the Darklands to seek Ilvarandin themselves, though they may become embroiled in a war deep\n  underground. While most Darklands lore has evolved in Pathfinder Second Edition, information about these vaults can be\n  found in the Pathfinder First Edition book <em>Pathfinder Chronicles: Into the Darklands</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Wrath of the Witch-Priest:</strong> The demonic legacy of the Pit owes as much to the presence of the demon\n  queen @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.aipkJQxP4GBsTaGq]{Lamashtu} as it does Pazuzu, but in this adventure, only agents of the King of the Wind Demons have a significant\n  role. Yet those who venerate Lamashtu also see the Pit as a noteworthy place—less as a site of religious fervor,\n  though, and more of a place of shame and disgust. Today, Lamashtu and Pazuzu are bitter enemies, and the Pit is an\n  almost blasphemous reminder of a time in the distant past when this was not the case. For one local cultist, the\n  witch-priest Issandra, the Pit has long been a point of contention. As powerful herself as the Red Bishop, this elven\n  devotee of Lamashtu spends her time during the events of this adventure far to the southeast, attending a larger\n  temple she maintains in western Katapesh, but soon after the PCs defeat the Red Bishop she returns to her smaller\n  shrine hidden in Mosswood to the east of Sandpoint. Upon learning of recent events, she seeks out the PCs and proposes\n  a quest: make a risky infiltration of High M’Vania to destroy lingering evidence of Lamashtu and Pazuzu’s long-dead\n  alliance, or perhaps even confront and slay Uvaglor. Of course, Issandra is herself a cruel and evil woman, and the\n  PCs would be wise not to trust her too well, for her true motives may be just as manipulative and self-serving as\n  those held by the Red Bishop. More information about Issandra can be found in the Pathfinder First Edition book\n  <em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast</em>.\n</p>"

The empire has largely recovered from its time under the rule of the cruel Jade Regent, and while\n  Ameiko has grown into the role of leadership well, she harbors fond memories of simpler times spent in Sandpoint.\n  Still, her decision to return to her hometown is not something that can be taken lightly.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Word of her impending return to Sandpoint comes many months before the actual visit, as there is much she must do to\n  prepare for her departure—especially since she intends to travel back along the Path of Aganhei over the Crown of the\n  World when she makes her visit, retracing the steps she and several others took on her first voyage to Minkai.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Regardless, the news of her impending visit spreads through Sandpoint like a wave, with speculation about her motives,\n  anxieties about her visit, and excitement about her return filling the citizens of the town with a vibrant air of\n  expectation, anticipation, and more than anything else, panic. Ameiko has become one of the town’s most famous people,\n  after all, second only to those heroes who stood against runelord Karzoug a few years before her departure.

The four\n  founding families (a group called the Sandpoint Mercantile League that included the Kaijitsus, the Valdemars, the\n  Scarnettis, and the Deverins) chose a sheltered cove some 50 miles north of their hometown of Magnimar to settle—only\n  to find the site already occupied by local Varisians, who used the cove as a traditional waypoint during their travels\n  along the Lost Coast. Initial attempts to work with the Varisians to ensure they would retain a place in the\n  town-to-be collapsed when Alamon Scarnetti led several of his kin in a drunken attempt to murder the Varisians and\n  blame the slaughter on local goblins. The attack backfired horribly, with more Scarnettis slain than Varisians, and in\n  the months that followed it seemed that the dream of Sandpoint was done for as Magnimar’s Varisian Council demanded\n  punishment for all members of the Sandpoint Mercantile Guild.\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n  <img style=\"transform:scale(1)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/mm_logo_blue.svg\" alt=\"MetaMorphic Digital Studio\" title=\"MetaMorphic Digital Studio\" />\n  <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Scene Notes</span><span class=\"keepme\">Ambiance</span></h2>\n  <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Playlist.jiZHhpRzijFnRfaE.PlaylistSound.7mGjdku2S1VD7FDB]{Townscape Day} @UUID[Playlist.jiZHhpRzijFnRfaE.PlaylistSound.e7DQzmiv7HSLmgVG]{Townscape Indoors} @UUID[Playlist.jiZHhpRzijFnRfaE.PlaylistSound.isSNOXPBVwkHrAb7]{Townscape Night} @UUID[Playlist.jiZHhpRzijFnRfaE.PlaylistSound.upf95dUvxoS1s6L5]{Ambience Docks} @UUID[Playlist.jiZHhpRzijFnRfaE.PlaylistSound.9ZAy8iDSrHF92TVT]{Ambience Tavern} @UUID[Playlist.jiZHhpRzijFnRfaE.PlaylistSound.qtfl1yUZFprxgADo]{Ambience Coastline}</span>\n  </div>\n</section>\n\n<p>\n  But thanks to the remarkable diplomatic skills of a young bard named Almah Deverin, a peaceful accord was settled\n  upon. Not only did Almah manage to assuage the Varisians’ call for blood payment, she also salvaged the plans for\n  Sandpoint by promising to incorporate the worship of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.JgqH3BhuEuA4Zyqs]{Desna} into the town’s cathedral and offered to the Varisian\n  Council a generous share of all profits made by Sandpoint-based ventures for the next four decades. Saved from the\n  near disaster, Sandpoint went on to become a thriving community, and while those 40 years have come and gone,\n  Sandpoint’s government elected to extend the compact for another 20 years—much to the consternation of a few locals.\n  Now, with this extension due to expire in a mere two years, the Scarnettis and their allies have already started work\n  on ensuring that this “unfair allocation of profits” won’t last beyond 60 years.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In those 60 years, though, and despite the intolerances clung to by a minority of Sandpoint’s citizens, the town grew\n  into a thriving and welcoming settlement. The lumber and fishing industries boomed, becoming the town’s most\n  profitable exports, while local farms helped to ensure self-sufficiency. Yet while blatant racism and willful hate\n  seemed to be limited to only a few individuals, another tragic and more subtle form of ignorance swept through the\n  town when a foundling baby showed up on the stoop of the Sandpoint Cathedral in 4684 ar.\n</p>\n<p>\n  That child would grow up to be a spirited young woman named Nualia. Her foster father, Ezakien Tobyn, was also\n  Sandpoint’s religious leader, and as his adopted daughter grew older it became apparent that she was more than human.\n  Her appearance and grace bespoke a supernatural heritage, and by the time she was 10 it was obvious that she was, in\n  fact, an aasimar. Her unearthly countenance made other children either jealous or shy, and many took to playing cruel\n  jokes on her. The adults in town weren’t much better, as many viewed her as “blessed by Desna” and let their rural\n  superstitions take hold. Rumors that Nualia’s touch could cure warts and rashes, that locks of her hair brewed into\n  tea could increase fertility, and that her voice could drive out evil spirits led to a succession of awkward and\n  humiliating requests. Perhaps worst of all was Ezakien himself. He simultaneously took advantage of the upswell of\n  religious fervor triggered by Nualia’s presence in town, which increased donations to the cathedral, and kept her\n  under a stultifying curfew meant to preserve her “purity” so she could eventually join a prestigious convent in\n  Andoran—a plan Ezakien hoped would earn him a more comfortable position in a “much more civilized” part of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n  By the time Nualia turned 18, she felt more like a freak than anything else, but when a manipulative man named Delek\n  began to woo her, she quickly fell in love. When he later abandoned her after learning she’d become pregnant, Nualia\n  tearfully turned to her foster father for support, only for him to overreact and forbid her from leaving the church so\n  he could watch over her and lecture her on the virtues he felt she should follow. This was not only the final step in\n  Ezakien’s fall from grace, but also set into motion a series of events that would ultimately end in a tragic fire that\n  burned much of the cathedral to the ground and left Ezakien Tobyn and Nualia dead. Or so the people of Sandpoint\n  thought.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, Nualia not only survived the fire, but was the one who started it. After living a life of loneliness and\n  disappointment, and after enduring the birth of a monstrous child who lived only moments before dying, Nualia had come\n  to believe that @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.aipkJQxP4GBsTaGq]{Lamashtu} was the only solution. Holy men and celestial ancestry had only brought her despair and pain,\n  after all, and so she fell to the worship of the Mother of Monsters. In her dreams, Nualia envisioned a “rebirth” as a\n  demon, but in order to achieve this freedom from her past, Lamashtu demanded sacrifices. Nualia gathered several\n  goblins and a handful of mercenaries to her cause and engineered a devastating attack on Sandpoint with the ultimate\n  goal to offer the town as burned offerings to Lamashtu, only for her plans to be foiled by a group of adventurers. Her\n  death saved Sandpoint from devastation, but what few in Sandpoint truly realized was that they had contributed to the\n  tragedy themselves. Had Nualia been treated well, things might have turned out differently both for her and the town\n  itself.\n</p>\n<section class=\"action\">\n  <h2 class=\"split\"><span>Sandpoint</span><span>Settlement 4</span></h2>\n  <ul class=\"traits\">\n    <li class=\"trait\">NG</li>\n    <li class=\"trait\">town</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Diverse coastal town caught in the middle of sinister plots</p>\n  <p><strong>Government</strong> Mayor (elected leader)</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Population</strong> 1,240 (89% humans, 3% halflings, 2% elves, 2% dwarves, 1% gnomes, 1% half-elves, 1%\n    half-orcs, 0.5% goblins, 0.5% other)\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Varisian, Shoanti</p>\n  <hr />\n  <p><strong>Religions</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.d56paSkcwvll2OhR]{Abadar}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.AlL9GtlTldbqNoVm]{Calistria}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.JgqH3BhuEuA4Zyqs]{Desna}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.mm1j6UbHqFCI8fwB]{Erastil}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.swwwP7eVmlNuWTb7]{Gozreh}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.BNycwu3I21dTh4D9]{Sarenrae}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.gxwmzxUWBOhdgFSN]{Shelyn}\n</p>\n  <p><strong>Threats</strong> ancient hidden dangers, criminals, goblins, ghouls</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Quick to Chat</strong> The majority of Sandpoint’s citizens are eager to gossip and spread news.

Some of these have held power since the town’s foundation, while others are\n  new to the political scene. Traditionally, power in Sandpoint has resided among its four founding families, but with\n  two of these families (the Kaijitsus and the Valdemars) having turned their attentions elsewhere, and one of them (the\n  Scarnettis) only now coming out from a bevy of legal issues, political power in Sandpoint has moved away from a faux\n  aristocracy headed by four families toward a larger set of factions representing a wider and more accurate view of the\n  town’s interests. Each of these factions represent groups with which the PCs can build reputation—but as ever in\n  matters political, earning favor with one faction can earn the hatred of another.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Bunyip Club:</strong> This group consists of an organized band of criminals led by Jubrayl Vhiski, and is the\n  closest thing in Sandpoint to a thieves’ guild. They maintain an underground hideout in the old smuggler’s tunnels\n  below town, but it’s well known in town that the Feedbag (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11thefeedbag0000]{42} on the map of Sandpoint) is a front\n  for the club.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Runewatchers:</strong> The newest group to rise to power in town are the loosely affiliated Runewatchers. Ever\n  since Thassilon’s legacy leapt to the forefront of Varisia’s international reputation (triggered in no small part by\n  events that took place right here in town 17 years prior), the Runewatchers have collected lore and tales about old\n  Thassilon while also keeping an eye out for new problems associated with the ancient nation’s legacy. The Runewatchers\n  meet on the first day of each season at Brodert Quink’s home (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11brodertshous00]{8}) to share rumors and\n  news—gatherings that have mostly become glorified social visits of late.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Sandpoint Cathedral:</strong> Sandpoint’s current religious leader is Abstalar Zantus, an elderly man who,\n  it’s rumored, is eager to retire and pass the proverbial torch to a new priest. The cathedral itself is the largest\n  building in town (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11sandpointcat00]{1}).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Sandpoint Mercantile League:</strong> The oldest faction in town is the Sandpoint Mercantile League.\n  Originally consisting of members from the town’s four founding families, the Mercantile League today counts most of\n  Sandpoint’s shopkeepers, innkeepers, and providers among their number. The Sandpoint Mercantile League bases its\n  operations out of a large building near the town’s waterfront (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11mercantilele00]{40}).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Scarnetti Consortium:</strong> After several brushes with legal trouble, local businessman and aristocrat\n  Titus Scarnetti consolidated and rebuilt his holdings into the Scarnetti Consortium. With the retreat of the Valdemars\n  from town, the Scarnettis have bolstered their presence in Sandpoint’s industries, and today the Consortium is the\n  greatest rival for Sandpoint’s wealth to the long-established Mercantile League. The Scarnettis run the Consortium\n  from their manor (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11scarnettiman00]{48}).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Town Watch:</strong> Sheriff Belor Hemlock continues to command the Town Watch, although he’s increasingly\n  relied upon the assistance of his wife Kaye Tesarani to handle the delicate matters of politics and public relations.\n  The Town Watch patrols both the settlement’s streets and the roads through its hinterlands, and are responsible for\n  the safety of the citizens. The Town Watch is based out of the Sandpoint garrison (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11sandpointgar00]{10}).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Townsfolk:</strong> Finally, there are the townsfolk themselves, ably represented by their mayor, Kendra\n  Deverin. Kendra keeps a manor to the south of town, but the business of running Sandpoint and seeing to the needs of\n  its people are focused in the town hall (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11sandpointtow00]{11}).\n</p>"

Any PC can attempt to Earn Income in Sandpoint with a\n  Crafting, Lore, or Performance check, but the maximum task level that can normally be attempted in town is equal to\n  that of Sandpoint’s level: 4.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A shady PC can attempt to Earn Income through petty crime such as pickpocketing, running con games, or even minor\n  burglaries, but without support, a freelance criminal in Sandpoint runs a greater risk of punishment. As with other\n  methods of earning income, unsupported Thievery in town is limited to a maximum task level of 4. If a PC fails at an\n  attempt to Earn Income with Thievery, they can abandon any payment they would have earned from the failure to escape\n  repercussions, otherwise they’re caught in the act; a critical failure guarantees being caught. Each time a PC is\n  caught during freelance Thievery, the party loses [[/r 1d4]] Reputation Points from every faction. For minor crimes, the PC\n  is expected to return all stolen property and pay a fine to the town equal to twice the value of the property they\n  stole or face a number of days in jail in the garrison (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11sandpointgar00]{10}).

The specific benefits are based on the location’s traits and are listed below.\n  This support generally lasts throughout the campaign, although sometimes events in play can automatically adjust\n  support—some examples are noted in the individual adventures, but other events in the game should have ramifications\n  as well. There’s no limit to the number of locations that can support the party; once the PCs gain the support of a\n  location, they retain it until significant events say otherwise.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some locations allow certain types of characters to retrain more efficiently once they’ve made that location’s NPC\n  Helpful. In such a location, retraining that would normally require a week takes only 5 days, retraining that would\n  normally require a month takes only 3 weeks, and the retraining itself is generally free.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Every location’s first tag indicates what faction it belongs to. The first time anyone in the party earns the support\n  of a location, the party increases their Reputation Points with that faction by 1, unless they are already admired or\n  hated, in which case no Reputation Points are earned.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Criminal:</strong> Characters who focus on criminal activities can retrain efficiently at this location. A\n  character who uses Underworld Lore to Earn Income gains a +1 circumstance bonus on the check. A character can use\n  Thievery to Earn Income (the task level is equal to or less than the NPC’s level), but a critical failure on this\n  check may result in legal action or possible imprisonment.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Employer:</strong> The location offers tasks up to its level for PCs to Earn Income using Crafting (to craft\n  items associated with the location) or any of the skills mentioned in the entry once it supports the PCs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Garrison:</strong> Martially inclined characters can retrain efficiently here.

On-site Create Forgery, Decipher Writing, Research, or Learn a Spell checks gain a +1 item bonus.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Lodge:</strong> Primal spellcasters can retrain efficiently here.

The exact nature and magnitude of the favor is determined by the GM, but once\n  the favor is granted, that NPC cannot be called upon for another favor for a period of time—typically one year, but\n  this duration can shift to match the scope of the favor.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Parlor:</strong> Socially inclined and skill-focused PCs can retrain more efficiently here.

She was researching variants of the clone\n    ritual in a series of laboratories one level down from the higher-ranking spy barracks.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>10 Research Points</strong> Liralarue underwent extensive secret retraining to abandon the traditions of\n    magic she learned as Karzoug’s apprentice to shift her area of focus from transmutation magic to divination magic—a\n    practice unheard of among Thassilon’s wizards.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>12 Research Points</strong> Some of Liralarue’s research revealed that King Xin, the long-dead (even for her\n    time) founder of Thassilon, hadn’t envisioned a Thassilon ruled by Runelords, but instead envisioned a more\n    cooperative nation. Liralarue considers this revelation to mark Xin as a foolish idealist and notes that had he been\n    more practiced in divination magic, perhaps he could’ve foreseen the treachery that led to his death and the loss of\n    his nation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>14 Research Points</strong> Liralarue sought other methods of bolstering her resources in her quest for\n    power—demonology and the crafting of constructs were chiefly among them. Mention of a special “song key” hidden in a\n    @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.mnEj7ll9WffO8WLu]{Clockwork Songbird} is uncovered—supposedly, when wound, this clockwork songbird’s song can open a complex lock\n    somewhere deeper in the Pit, but there’s no indication of where the clockwork songbird is now.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>16 Research Points</strong> Liralarue hoped to develop her mastery of divination to the point where she\n    could found an eighth school of Thassilonian magic, one focused on divination and that allowed the specialist to\n    choose which two schools of magic they wished to exclude from their studies. The rune of this theoretical school of\n    Thassilonian magic was a circle with seven hooks along its circumference, and it was associated with the sin of\n    vainglory—a sin some conflate with pride yet is more about the obsessive need to be seen and vanity than it is about\n    an overinflated sense of self-worth and the importance of one’s deeds.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>18 Research Points</strong> In addition to developing her own school of magic, Liralarue hoped to emerge\n    into the political scene of Thassilon as an eighth runelord but never quite reached the point in power where she\n    felt comfortable taking such a step. Instead, in the final months she had left before Earthfall, she turned her\n    focus toward the task of reverse engineering a runewell, in hopes of transforming the entire Pit into an immense\n    well of divinatory power from which she could draw strength.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>20 Research Points</strong> Liralarue was interested in clockworks and the art of infusing them with magic.\n    Of particular note is her construction of a unique clockwork songbird that, when activated, could produce a complex\n    song that she keyed to the entrance to her vault (giving the PCs all the instructions they’ll need to open the\n    portal in area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20007apatte.JournalEntryPage.07singingdoor000]{H13} once they recover and rebuild the clockwork songbird). A final scrawled note\n    indicates Liralarue’s plan to disassemble the songbird and entrust the components to her most valued agents in\n    Thassilon’s final days. This precaution would prevent easier raids on her vault should she be kept from returning to\n    her treasury if the upcoming disaster, which she felt was imminent, proved to be worse than she feared (it\n    absolutely was).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>22 Research Points</strong> In the final days before Earthfall, Liralarue’s skill at divination warned her\n    that an apocalyptic event would devastate Thassilon. She grew increasingly frustrated when her attempts to learn\n    more only enhanced her fears without providing details or clues on how to escape devastation. In some of her last\n    notes, she admits a deep personal realization—that divination should remain unstudied because knowledge of the\n    future can’t help and will only distract and fill you with dread, overwhelming you with the feeling of hopelessness.\n    “I know the world will soon end, and I’ve wasted my last days fighting against it rather than living my final\n    moments to their fullest extent,” she writes in her most recent entry.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>24 Research Points</strong> By making inferences about what they’ve learned about Liralarue so far, the PC\n    makes an astounding discovery—a potent magical defensive trick that Liralarue hid among her writings. The PC gains\n    the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.FwI9BgkmMQ25ltVI]{Liralarue's Glimpse} reaction and can teach this reaction to another PC by spending 8 hours of downtime and succeeding at a\n    @Check[arcana|dc:30]\n check to impart the magical knowledge.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"action\">\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Liralarue’s Glimpse <span class=\"pf2-icon\">r</span></h2>\n  <ul class=\"traits\">\n    <li class=\"trait\">rare</li>\n    <li class=\"trait\">Arcane</li>\n    <li class=\"trait\">divination</li>\n    <li class=\"trait\">Fortune</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n  <p><strong>Trigger</strong> You fail or critically fail a saving throw or attack roll.</p>\n  <p><strong>Requirements</strong> You aren’t stupefied.</p>\n  <hr />\n  <p class=\"no-indent\">\n    You suddenly realize that what you thought was a catastrophic failure on your part was actually a supernaturally\n    realistic vision from your immediate future.

These succubi sought to slay a powerful witch who had befouled a profane temple the assassins\n  served. The succubi failed at their mission, but from their corpses grew the first fungus tyrants. Pleased with this\n  development, the witch then seeded numerous worlds on the Material Plane with fungus tyrant spores, who have since\n  grown and thrived in their new environments as rot thrives in a corpse. Today, hundreds of fungus tyrants inhabit the\n  fouler locales of the Material Plane. They’re particularly fond of large cave systems and ruined cities, but also can\n  be found in corrupted woodlands where blighted fey rule or in the sewers of active cities that spew vast amounts of\n  magical waste.\n</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 fungus tyrant.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 fungus tyrant.webp')\" />\n<p>\n  An encounter with a normally unintelligent plant monster acting with methodical intent can be evidence of a fungus\n  tyrant’s manipulations, but fungus tyrants are equally fond of keeping other types of creatures as pets and\n  thralls—particularly attractive humanoids. Especially favored minions are given the gift of the fungus tyrant’s\n  embrace and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to their pallid ruler. Yet most fungus tyrants realize\n  that a diverse array of guardians is best, and they often choose to keep some non-fungus minions on hand to protect\n  their lair.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Fungus tyrants are violently jealous. Any who attempt to lure away their dominated pets or cure those who have been\n  infected by them earns their eternal ire. Yet it’s succubi who enrage fungus tyrants the most. In these demons, the\n  fungus tyrant sees a former glamour and power they no longer have access to, and only the brutal destruction of these\n  mocking memories can salve a fungus tyrant’s anger. A fungus tyrant faced with someone whom they suspect might be a\n  succubus is terrible indeed, for in such battles, the fiendish fungal beings abandon their normal approach of subtle\n  mental trickery and bring all of their power to bear in an attempt to rip the offending creature apart. Fungus tyrants\n  also take great delight in transforming succubi into fungoid creatures under their control.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While their jealousy doesn’t compel them to do battle with other fungus tyrants, they’re always careful to maintain\n  their own territories apart from any nearby kin, and they take great pains not to “poach” other tyrant’s charmed and\n  infested pets.\n</p>\n<p>A fungus tyrant is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.</p>\n<aside class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Spore Thralls</h1>\n    <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO92102 RULES.webp\" />\n    <p>\n      When a creature becomes a spore thrall, it rises from death with the same statistics it had in life, but gains the\n      fungus trait, as well as immunity to death effects, disease, paralyzed, and poison, and its alignment switches to\n      match that of the fungus tyrant who created them. When a spore thrall is slain, its soul finally travels to the\n      Boneyard for judgment, but the fungus-encrusted physical remains often spawn new fungal creatures, such as\n      myceloids, violet fungi, or drakauthixes.

After arriving in the bustling new town a mere 2 years after it was\n  founded in 4666 ar, the talented Nidalese expatriate set up shop near the southern waterfront and achieved moderate\n  success, providing the townsfolk with a ready source of herbal remedies, alchemically enhanced fishing bait, and other\n  helpful elixirs and tinctures. Yet Endinyon kept his biggest source of income a secret, for it was this that had\n  gotten him run out of Nidal—he was an accomplished body snatcher. For the next three years, he supplied corpses to\n  disreputable sorts in Magnimar to the south and smaller villages like Galduria, Wolf’s Ear, and even Ravenmoor to the\n  north. But when a particularly large and complicated order to Riddleport involving bodies that weren’t quite dead yet\n  backfired, the citizens of Sandpoint rose up and burned his shop to the ground. Endinyon fled into the smuggler’s\n  tunnels underneath the city, traveling away from Sandpoint where his enemies were searching high and low for him.\n  Ironically, he followed the smuggler’s tunnels into a network of ghoul warrens and eventually ended up below Pauper’s\n  Graves to the east of town: a site where he’d stolen many bodies in the past. Unfortunately, those thefts had\n  particularly enraged the ghasts who still dwelt there. Endinyon died, captured and tortured by the ghasts whose\n  “pantry” he’d raided too often, only to rise as a ghast himself.\n</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 kanker.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Kanker\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 kanker.webp')\" />\n<p>\n  Over the next several years, the man who was once Endinyon reinvented himself into something new—a ghast called\n  Kanker. It was in the deeper ghoul caves below Pauper’s Graves that he first discovered Kabriri’s faith, and it wasn’t\n  long before he converted. Eventually, Kanker’s enterprising nature and leadership skills helped him rise to power\n  among the undead who dwelt below the Sandpoint hinterlands. Yet he always harbored anger and a need for revenge\n  against the people of Sandpoint for ruining what he had started to build.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Kanker left the other ghasts, explored the Darklands below the Lost Coast, and eventually found his way into the\n  chambers surrounding the Pit. There, he discovered the ancient temple that occupied its lowest reaches, and he knew\n  he’d found his new calling. He began the task of clearing out the temple to be one appropriate to the demon lord of\n  ghouls and secrets kept by the dead, and in time he was joined by a small following of like-minded ghast cultists—most\n  of whom also bore grudges against the ghouls of the Lost Coast and the citizens of Sandpoint alike.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For years, Kanker was content to study and worship, but during a trip through the Sandpoint hinterlands to forage for\n  alchemical supplies, a chance meeting with a looming presence who possessed haunting red eyes gave the ghast a new\n  direction. His encounter with the Red Bishop inspired Kanker, making him realize that he deserved more than just an\n  ancient crypt temple in the hinterlands. He and his ghasts deserved Sandpoint, and if Kanker would aid the Red Bishop\n  by assisting another group who had become active in the region, the Midnight Dawn, the dooms that would soon come to\n  Sandpoint would give Kanker all he needed to turn the town into his own domain of undeath.\n</p>"

If he can\n  orchestrate a great calamity or deadly disaster to take out his enemies, he’ll do that instead of confronting them in\n  battle. Yet at the end of this adventure, when he makes contact with his latest “project” (the PCs), he’s likely to be\n  forced into a fight.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When combat is unavoidable, the Red Bishop fights with as many allies as possible, so that he can remain at range and\n  cast spells against foes. <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.tlcrVRqW1MSKJ5IC]{Phantasmal Killer}Phantasmal killer</em> is one of his favorites—those who are targeted by this spell endure\n  realistic visions of horrific, world-ending disasters that seem to focus the brunt of their devastation on the victim.\n  When fighting with allies in this way, he deactivates his Portentous Gaze, but he’ll activate it at once if he’s\n  surrounded or reduced to fewer than 150 Hit Points, regardless of any minions or allies he might frighten. In melee,\n  the Red Bishop uses his longsword with frightening effectiveness. Those who try to engage him up close might expect a\n  weak spellcaster, and they might not live to regret that mistake.

Originally drawn from distant lands\n  by the lure of his demonic patron’s influence over the region, the Red Bishop was delighted to find not only an\n  ancient shrine devoted to Pazuzu hidden within the rock of Chopper’s Isle on @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap20011sandpo.JournalEntryPage.11adoomedtown000#sandpointsettlement-4]{Sandpoint's} outskirts, but a much more\n  ancient and powerful legacy in the depths of the Pit itself. Here, he knew a thin spot existed between the Material\n  Plane and the Abyssal realm of High M’vania, where Pazuzu ruled. Yet an ancient ward kept the potential rupture in\n  reality in check. Unable to directly undo this ward, and indeed, preferring long, slow corruption and cruelty to swift\n  pain and immediate ruin, the Red Bishop settled into the region to begin a plan that would take over two decades to\n  come to fruition.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Sandpoint’s fortunes grew darker the day the Red Bishop arrived. Life there was already hard, but once the Red Bishop\n  began to manipulate events, things grew undeniably worse. It was the Red Bishop who ensured that local eccentric\n  Jervis Stoot would find and become corrupted by the statuette of Pazuzu that would give rise to Chopper’s murder\n  spree. It was the Red Bishop whose nightmare sendings and whispered poison caused so many in Sandpoint to act awfully\n  toward Nualia, eventually resulting in the devastating fire that nearly burned the Sandpoint Cathedral to the ground.\n  And while the Red Bishop himself was not directly responsible for the rise of Runelord Karzoug, his subtle\n  manipulations certainly helped to spread the influence of the minor runewell of wrath hidden below Sandpoint so that\n  certain powerful locals became more prone to cruelty.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For the next 20 years, Sandpoint has endured one tragedy after another. And while the grief caused by the Red Bishop’s\n  influence amused him, it was but a side effect of his primary goal. For such events were the best way to cultivate the\n  very tools he needed to see to the destruction of Sazzleru’s ward in the Pit. Adventurers were the Red Bishop’s goal,\n  adventurers who weren’t direct agents of the Abyss but, as with so many mortals, could be manipulated into doing the\n  Red Bishop’s bidding.\n</p>"

There are even a small number of <strong>goblins</strong> dwelling in\n  the town—something that would have been unheard of just a few decades ago! Goblin PCs would do well to be on their\n  best behavior, of course, but since this adventure starts at 4th level, you can assume that a heroic goblin PC has\n  already established themself in town alongside the other PCs as a welcome local. Still, Sandpoint continues to\n  periodically have difficulties with more aggressive goblin communities that remain in the hinterlands, and some people\n  in town may still carry fearful prejudices close to their hearts. Work with your GM to establish an understanding if\n  you wish to play a goblin character in this campaign, but also keep in mind that you are likely to encounter\n  villainous goblins during the course of play! (The same goes, of course, for any of the core ancestries!)\n</p>\n<h3 data-split-here=\"Uncommon Ancestries\">Uncommon Ancestries</h3>\n<p>\n  These ancestries are much less common on the Lost Coast, but a few of them might include some NPCs living quiet lives\n  in town at the GM’s whim. Speak to your GM before selecting an uncommon ancestry from this section, but these choices\n  shouldn’t present any significant thematic clashes with the Adventure Path as a whole.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i> Ancestries:</strong> Kobolds and orcs are known in Varisia. While they generally dwell\n  far to the east, in the regions known as the Storval Plateau or the Cinderlands, their appearance on the Lost Coast\n  isn’t particularly unusual. As with goblins, you can assume that as part of your time spent as a 1st- to 3rd-level\n  character in Sandpoint, you’ve built enough of a reputation that the locals won’t react poorly to the presence of a\n  kobold or orc.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Changelings, dhampirs, and planar scions are all known in the region as well. There are no particularly numerous\n  enclaves of these versatile heritages in the region, but their presence isn’t disruptive or out of place. In some\n  cases, if you look particularly unusual or notable, certain locals might react with faulty predispositions against you\n  and your heritage, but again, your established reputation in town as an adventurer will go a long way toward extending\n  your welcome in town.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><i>Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</i> Ancestries:</strong> The practice of fleshwarping dates back to before Earthfall,\n  when the runelords of ancient Thassilon dabbled in this magical tradition to create monstrous servants or hideous\n  guardians. The most widespread fleshwarps in the region today are sinspawn, who remain pretty universally loathed or\n  feared for their monstrous appearance or aberrant world views, but more unique fleshwarps, such as those presented in\n  this book, can find safe havens on the Lost Coast.\n</p>\n<h3 data-split-here=\"Rare Ancestries\">Rare Ancestries</h3>\n<p>\n  Any other ancestry not mentioned above is considered rare. While these ancestries can work from a game balance\n  perspective, they aren’t particularly on-theme for <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i>. If you wish to play a rare ancestry,\n  speak with your GM first.\n</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\"><h1 class=\"no-toc\">Local Prejudices</h1>\n<p>\n  Sandpoint has had its historic struggles with prejudice, be it clashes between indigenous Varisians and new Taldan\n  arrivals, conflicts with local violent goblin communities, experiences with frightening fleshwarps like sinspawn, or\n  ignorant but nevertheless damaging actions against heritages like aasimars. While some in Sandpoint still cling to\n  their prejudices, others are taking steps to do better, and certain story elements in <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i>\n  explore how the townsfolk of Sandpoint are trying to do just that. If you wish to play a goblin, aasimar, tiefling,\n  fleshwarp, or other ancestry who you fear might face cruelty, chat with your GM to make sure your choice will work\n  well for your table and game.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Regardless, the people of Sandpoint are mostly good and mostly welcoming–the presence of villains and scoundrels among\n  the townsfolk are part of what builds compelling storylines for adventurers to go on and sets up wrongs for heroes to\n  right. As mentioned above, you can assume that regardless of your character’s ancestry (provided you have your GM’s\n  approval if you’re playing an uncommon or rare ancestry), your character’s actions during your first three levels of\n  experience have given the people of Sandpoint plenty of time to come to admire and respect you. There are still\n  antagonists waiting to confront you and your party in town, but their goals are tied specifically to the events\n  awaiting you in <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i> and are not tied to your character’s ancestry.\n</p>\n</aside>"

              "name": "Classes",
              "text": "<h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Classes\">Classes</h2>\n<p>\n  The pursuit of adventuring is common along the Lost Coast, particularly in the wake of so many significant events over\n  the past 17 years—stories chronicled in Adventure Paths like Rise of the Runelords, Second Darkness, Jade Regent,\n  Shattered Star, and Return of the Runelords, or in standalone adventures like <i>Feast of Ravenmoor</i>. As a result, all\n  classes are appropriate for play in <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i>. Some, like the gunslinger, might find the availability\n  of certain uncommon resources in town unreliable, while others, like the magi, may not find locals in Sandpoint to\n  “talk shop” with, but all will have ample opportunities to shine during the adventures to come!\n</p>\n<h3>Alchemists</h3>\n<p>\n  are represented in town by two notable characters—Aliver “Pillbug” Podiker and Nisk\n  Tander. Of the two, Nisk, who runs Bottled Solutions, is far more approachable and friendly. Aliver Podiker, who runs\n  the Pillbug’s Pantry, is an abrasive and unpleasant man who has little interest in making friends with adventurers.\n  All alchemical research fields are equally appropriate for <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i>.\n</p>\n<h3>Barbarians</h3>\n<p>\n  in the region are almost always lone warriors associated with an adventuring group, but\n  are quite common and often admired for their strength and endurance. The Shoanti quahs of eastern Varisia are the most\n  notable established groups for barbarians to hail from. All barbarian instincts are thematically appropriate for the\n  region, but Giant is the most thematic, for Varisia has long been the homeland for numerous types of giants, and their\n  legacy can be seen in the immense Thassilonian ruins scattered throughout the land.\n</p>\n<h3>Bards</h3>\n<p>\n  are particularly adored in Sandpoint, for the town has many theatrical traditions, be it\n  competitive storytelling (“yarning”) at the Hagfish, full theatrical productions at the Sandpoint Theater, or the\n  various venues throughout town that cater to and welcome performances of all kinds. And of course, the legacy of\n  Sandpoint’s most famous bard, Ameiko Kaijitsu, carries on in the Rusty Dragon—while she’s moved on to become empress\n  of distant Minkai, many in town are still eager to share their favorite stories about the famous bard. All bard muses\n  are excellent choices in <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i>. If you choose enigma as your muse, consider ties to the ancient\n  mysteries of Thassilon. Note that a major part of this adventure involves building and fostering relationships with a\n  number of local factions, so a bard who has strong social skills will be particularly useful during those parts of the\n  campaign that take place in town.\n</p>\n<h3>Champions</h3>\n<p>\n  are well known and admired on the Lost Coast for their roles not only in protecting\n  society, but in setting inspirations to follow. In Sandpoint, two noteworthy paladins lead very different lives, yet\n  both are always eager to encourage and support newcomers to the cause. Gaven Deverin owns Sandpoint’s Two Knight\n  Brewery, an establishment that specializes in ciders, lambics, and seasonal beers and ales, while Jasper Korvaski tuns\n  the local Mercantile League, where he oversees matters as diverse as land ownership, building construction, and the\n  logistics of shipping via land or sea. In this Adventure Path, a champion should consider that\n  <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i> features a large amount of underground exploration, and that a steed is not a good\n  choice for a divine ally.\n</p>\n<h3>Clerics</h3>\n<p>\n  should consider the additional information presented next under Faiths for guidelines for\n  which deity to worship.\n</p>\n<h3>Druids</h3>\n<p>\n  are well known in the region, but have no members living directly in the town of Sandpoint. No\n  druid order is a bad choice for this Adventure Path, but keep in mind that there is relatively little wilderness\n  exploration in <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i>. The following animals are the most common found on the Lost Coast, so\n  choosing one of these as an animal companion will be on-theme (if you wish to choose a different animal companion,\n  speak to your GM about how this animal might have become your companion under unusual circumstances): badger, bat\n  (<i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i> 144), bear, bird, boar (<i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i> 144), cat, horse, snake, or wolf.\n</p>\n<h3>Fighters</h3>\n<p>\n  are among the most common adventurers in the region and will find ample opportunity to shine\n  during <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i>. Sheriff Belor Hemlock is perhaps the town’s most famous fighter.\n</p>\n<h3>Gunslingers</h3>\n<p>\n  are uncommon in Sandpoint, and their initial arrival in town always draws plenty of\n  gawkers and curious folks eager to see a demonstration of gunplay. If you wish to play a gunslinger, make sure your GM\n  knows—local shops like Savah’s Armory can stock gunslinger supplies, but if there are no gunslinger PCs in the group,\n  her shop won’t be offering guns and associated gear for sale without adjustments put in place by your GM.\n</p>\n<h3>Inventors</h3>\n<p>\n  aren’t particularly common on the Lost Coast. Those who do come to Varisia are often\n  seeking answers to the mysteries of Thassilon’s ancient techniques for creating clockworks, and rumors abound of still\n  to-be-discovered clockworks buried in ancient Thassilonian complexes. While no inventors currently live in Sandpoint,\n  Vorvashali Voon, the proprietor of the local curio shop known as the Feathered Serpent, is always on the lookout for\n  opportunities to talk with inventors, and if anywhere in town will carry supplies needed for such pursuits, it’s his\n  shop. No one innovation is more thematic than another in <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i>.\n</p>\n<h3>Investigators</h3>\n<p>\n  are often drawn to the Lost Coast in pursuit of ancient mysteries, and while none\n  currently live in Sandpoint, many in town would be eager to trade stories or talk mysteries with them, including local\n  sage Brodert Quink. Opportunities to research mysteries and investigate mysterious events occur often in this\n  Adventure Path, so an investigator should find their skills useful numerous times during play. Alchemical Sciences and\n  Forensic Medicine are slightly stronger thematic choices (but not much so) than Empiricism or Interrogation, as far as\n  investigator methodologies are concerned.\n</p>\n<h3>Kineticists</h3>\n<p>\n  will find plenty of chances to shine during combat and exploration in Seven Dooms for\n  Sandpoint, with those focused on the elements of air, earth, or fire potentially having the stronger thematic ties to\n  the plot. Of all the classes presented here, kineticists are perhaps the least understood, with many locals mistaking\n  them for sorcerers. Once made aware of their mistake though, most in Sandpoint are eager to find out more about this\n  strange (to them) “new form of magic.”\n</p>\n<h3>Magi</h3>\n<p>\n  will find their talents useful throughout this Adventure Path, but aren’t overwhelmingly tied to\n  its plot in a strong thematic way. Local wizards like Veznutt Parooh of The Way North or Ilsoari Gandethus of\n  Turandarok Academy are always delighted to trade stories and talk magical theory with magi, while tavernkeeper Chask\n  Haladan of the Curious Goblin might become intrigued by the melding of magic and weaponry a magus pursues, although\n  more as how it might apply to stage performances than to actual battle.\n</p>\n<h3>Monks</h3>\n<p>\n  are, like fighters, common on the Lost Coast, and will find ample opportunities to shine in\n  this Adventure Path’s numerous combats. Sandpoint’s most famous monk is Jabyl Sorn, caretaker of the House of Blue\n  Stones—a place for meditation and study alike. See Faiths on page 9 for additional guidance on religion or belief.\n</p>\n<h3>Oracles</h3>\n<p>\n  aren’t quite as common on the Lost Coast as clerics, but the talents they bring to a party\n  will be just as useful. The most thematically appropriate mysteries for an oracle in this Adventure Path are\n  Ancestors, Cosmos, Flames, and Lore. See Faiths on page 9 for additional guidance on religion or belief.\n</p>\n<h3>Psychics</h3>\n<p>\n  aren’t particularly common among the adventurers of the Lost Coast, and most locals will\n  assume a psychic to be some other form of spellcaster. Those who focus their studies and powers on themes associated\n  with ancient mysteries, the spirit world and supernatural threats, and the research of old magic and ruins will find\n  themselves fitting in well during <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i>.\n</p>\n<h3>Rangers</h3>\n<p>\n  are respected on the Lost Coast, where many patrol the remote roads to make travel safer.\n  While Sandpoint’s most notorious ranger resident, Daviren Hosk (a bitter and cranky man whose hatred of goblins is\n  slowly making him more and more of a local liability), isn’t the most pleasant person to cozy up to, most of the\n  town’s other residents will quickly gravitate toward a ranger with questions about local events or just admiration for\n  the job so many of them do in patrolling the Lost Coast Road. If you gain an animal companion, consult the suggestions\n  for druids on page 6. If you take the Favored Terrain feat, underground is the single most important terrain to\n  consider—no other terrain will feature significantly enough in the Adventure Path to give you a worthwhile advantage.\n</p>\n<h3>Rogues</h3>\n<p>\n  will find ample opportunities to shine during combat and dungeon exploration—many hazards\n  await! Beyond the dungeon, though, a rogue will also have multiple opportunities to engage in a range of social and\n  urban shenanigans in town; see the notes for bards and social encounters on page 6. Consider the advice for skills\n  later in this Player’s Guide when choosing where to focus your training.\n</p>\n<h3>Sorcerers</h3>\n<p>\n  are among the most respected adventures of all those on the Lost Coast, for the practice of\n  sorcery among the indigenous Varisians dates back to an era before even Thassilon. During that time, sorcery provided\n  Varisians under runelord rule a method to fight back against (or at least endure) the arcane cruelties visited upon\n  them by the then-rulers of the land. To many Varisians, the practice of sorcery is a religious experience, while to\n  others it is steeped inexorably with the magic of the land itself. As a result, sorcerers whose bloodlines afford\n  access to divine or primal magic are more common, but all four types of bloodline are thematically appropriate. The\n  most common are aberrant, angelic, demonic, fey, hag, imperial, and undead, but the most famous regional bloodline is\n  the harrow bloodline. While the Harrow itself plays no role in Seven Dooms for Sandpoint, it can be an excellent\n  thematic choice for any PC—this bloodline is detailed in the free <i>Stolen Fate Player’s Guide</i>, available online at\n  paizo.com. There have been many notable sorcerers living in Sandpoint over the years; some keep their magic secret,\n  but others use their traditions for the good of the town. For many years, Risa Magravi was one such sorcerer, whose\n  study of dreams and legend made her an important touchstone in the town’s oral history. Risa recently passed away, but\n  her daughter Lanalee seems more than capable of carrying on her mother’s traditions.\n</p>\n<h3>Summoners</h3>\n<p>\n  aren’t that well known on the Lost Coast, and are often mistaken for druids or other\n  spellcasters who have somehow managed to earn the loyalty of a strange supernatural follower—the main exception to\n  this generalization being those who summon phantom eidolons, who have a strong tradition among both the Varisians and\n  Shoanti who have lived in these lands for so long. The most thematically appropriate choices for eidolons in this\n  Adventure Path are angel, anger phantom, beast, demon, and devotion phantom.\n</p>\n<h3>Swashbucklers</h3>\n<p>\n  are similar to fighters, in that they’ll find plenty of chances to do their thing in\n  this Adventure Path. More so than fighters, though, their skill at social situations will be an additional asset when\n  it comes to building local reputation and navigating Sandpoint’s politics.\n</p>\n<h3>Thaumaturges</h3>\n<p>\n  are an excellent choice for this Adventure Path, although none currently live in\n  Sandpoint. The wide range of ancient magical ruins and forgotten treasures hidden throughout the land are a particular\n  draw for these treasure seekers. All thaumaturge implements are equally useful in this Adventure Path, though using an\n  implement emblazoned with, or incorporating themes from, ancient Thassilon (such as an amulet bearing the Sihedron\n  symbol, a polearm akin to those once wielded by the runelords, or regalia in the style of the ancient empire)\n  certainly fit well!\n</p>\n<h3>Witches</h3>\n<p>\n  are an important part of the region’s history, although less so than sorcerers. For many, the\n  witch is associated with more frightening elements of the region—be they associations with goblins, ghouls, or various\n  demon cults—but those who are open-minded are quick to point out the more positive traditions preserved by Varisian\n  witches of Desna, various worshippers of the empyreal lord mystery cults, or the increasing number of witches who seek\n  more benign and helpful magics hidden in the ancient runes of old Thassilon. Speak with your GM when choosing your\n  patron for additional guidance, but the patron themes of curse, fate, and rune are excellent choices in this Adventure\n  Path. When choosing a familiar, keep in mind many of the region’s traditional choices of bluetail skink,\n  butterfly/moth, cat, osprey, owl, raven, rat, seagull, spider, and thrush.\n</p>\n<h3>Wizards</h3>\n<p>\n  are among the most respected and feared classes, particularly in the current era where so\n  much harm and terror came to Varisia through the actions of runelords like Karzoug and Alaznist, whose recent return\n  nearly brought ruin to the land. Wizards who follow more modern traditions of magic are always more immediately\n  trusted as a result, and will find several potential wizardly allies in town, such as Veznutt Parooh or Ilsoari\n  Gandethus. Due to the nature of the peril facing Sandpoint, but more because the school was traditionally regarded as\n  “lesser” by the runelords of Thassilon, wizards who focus their studies on divination may find this Adventure Path\n  particularly rewarding, though practitioners of any wizard school will find moments to shine. The pursuit and study of\n  Thassilonian rune magic is on-theme for this Adventure Path, and there’s a new faction in Sandpoint, the Runewatchers,\n  who focus their efforts on studying these topics while also working to ensure new perils from ancient Thassilon are\n  dealt with quickly. Wizards who actually study these schools—particularly those who pursue the traditions of the\n  runelord archetype (<i>Secrets of Magic</i> 240)—will have a hard time earning the trust of Sandpoint’s locals. Still, this\n  archetype can make for particularly rewarding play in a <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i> game! If you want to play a\n  character who uses the runelord archetype, speak with your GM to ensure they’re comfortable with this potentially\n  complicated but equally rewarding choice.\n</p>"

              "text": "<h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Skills and Feats\">Skills and Feats</h2>\n<p>You’ll face a wide range of challenges and opportunities in <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i> in all three modes of play—encounter, exploration, and downtime. While the bulk of this adventure focuses on dungeon exploration and combat, significant portions see your group returning to Sandpoint to pursue social- and investigation-themed encounters. Skills that feature often in combat encounters (or immediately following), such as Acrobatics, Athletics, Medicine, and Stealth will be consistently useful through the campaign. All of these skills, save Acrobatics, also feature several specific examples where their use is helpful in overcoming non-combat encounters as well.</p>\n<p>Arcana, Occultism, and Religion will see plenty of use throughout the adventure as you encounter strange magical effects in the form of hazards, research topics, or stranger things. Nature will as well, just slightly less often than the other three.</p>\n<p>Social interaction will happen often in Sandpoint, but also now and then in the various site-based regions you’ll be exploring. Diplomacy and Intimidation will be used often to resolve non-combat encounters, with Deception as well to a lesser extent.</p>\n<p>Thievery will be particularly useful when you face locked doors or the numerous traps and hazards that lie in wait, but will have other applications as well. Society will be important in navigating certain site-based mysteries but even more so when navigating various social encounters in Sandpoint. You’ll face several opportunities to use Crafting and Performance to your advantage, in addition to their usefulness in Earning Income. Survival is perhaps the least applicable skill in this Adventure Path—it could be helpful in a few encounters, but unless you intend on @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.EA5vuSgJfiHH7plD]{Tracking} creatures often or retreating to the hinterlands to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.49y9Ec4bDii8pcD3]{Subsist} rather than take advantage of the numerous places to live in town, this skill is perhaps the least important in <em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em>.</p>\n<p>The most important Lore skill for <em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em> is obvious: Sandpoint Lore. Beyond this, Academia Lore, Library Lore, Mercantile Lore, and Poetry Lore all have a few points where they’ll be helpful in encounters, with Demon Lore and Sailing (or Piloting) Lore being useful each in specific encounters. And of course, Lore skills used to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1OagaWtBpVXExToo]{Recall Knowledge} about creatures will be consistently useful through the Adventure Path—if you’re interested in taking a creature lore skill, speak to your GM for advice. Lore skills have an additional use in this campaign as well: as the party’s reputation and relationship with various folks in town grow, more locations will support the use of Lore skills as an option to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.QyzlsLrqM0EEwd7j]{Earn Income}. These skills include Alcohol, Baking, Cooking, Engineering, Fishing, Forest (and to a lesser extent any terrain-based Lore), Guild, Labor, Mercantile, Sailing, Scouting, Scribing, Theater, and Underworld.</p>\n<p>You should avoid feats that work best in large cities or rely upon long-distance travel, as these elements do not play a role here. @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.P9HCz0uR6xPHuw72]{Multilingual} is a great choice if you want to pick up some of the uncommon or rare languages noted in Languages on page 9; feats that bolster your skill at downtime activities like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.t5nBkpjroaq7QBGK]{Research}, social encounters, influencing, and the like will see use during your time spent in Sandpoint itself. Feats that aid in dungeon exploration and combat will, of course, be quite useful, but those relying upon mounts or wilderness-based play will not be.</p>\n<p>Finally, it bears mentioning that while this is mostly a dungeon-crawl adventure, and while there might be the implication of being on a timer to complete the campaign, <em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em> is an excellent campaign to pursue downtime activities, such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.rmwa3OyhTZ2i2AHl]{Crafting} or Earning Income. The points where an imminent threat menaces town will be obvious and relatively uncommon, so your group should be able to take their time during this Adventure Path, coming and going from your homes in town as often as you need. Speak with your GM if you and your group are particularly interested in downtime or roleplaying interludes and encounters in Sandpoint, so they know to prepare for such play—in which case the GM can reference and research <em>Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast</em> for dozens of new encounters and plot points that can arise in town, depending on the players’ interests and actions! Again, that book also contains a fair amount of spoilers for Seven Dooms for Sandpoint, so if you intend to play this campaign, you should keep that in mind. If you need more information about Sandpoint, your GM is the best resource to rely upon.</p>"

Regardless of your beliefs, faith has been and remains a strong part of your life, and you’ve come to rely upon your faith to help you not only get through dangers in your adventures, but navigate the sometimes complex social problems that raise their ugly head in town. Conflicts between the cathedral and the Scarnettis seem like they’ve been growing lately.</p>\n  <p>You may live in one of the many apartments set aside for acolytes in the cathedral itself, or you might have family or own a small house elsewhere in town, but regardless of where you live, you’ve spent many an hour in the cathedral helping Abstalar—particularly when it comes to copying religious texts or otherwise serving as a scribe. It’s likely you play the part of healer in the party, but the drive to join an adventuring group itself may have even been inspired by Abstalar himself, who could have recognized in you an eagerness for adventuring, even before you did.</p>\n  <p>Choose two ability boosts.

From blacksmiths to leatherworkers, general stores to curio shops, taverns to theaters, or jewelers to cartographers, the number and variety of places available are often commented upon by visitors to the town as being unexpectedly welcome. Even with the closure of the now supposedly haunted Sandpoint Glassworks, or the damage done to many local establishments over the past few decades from fires, tsunamis, or monster raids, Sandpoint has always come back stronger. Growing up in town, you may have taken the opportunities for employment for granted, or perhaps your parents pulled strings to get you placed with a respected and talented local artisan, but being one of the town’s shopkeepers or service providers was never really what you wanted for yourself. Your years spent as an apprentice certainly kept you fit, but your heart has always been closer to the strange, dark, and mysterious. Whenever there was a slow stretch at work, you were quick to look through the latest book you’d bought or borrowed, or to express yourself by writing lines of poetry, and you’ve likely made several trips to the big city of Magnimar to browse occult shops or bookstores. Yet the money you earned as an apprentice never really gave you enough to buy the oddities you saw for sale.</p>\n  <p>You hope that becoming an adventurer will solve this, for adventurers can not only find themselves with sudden windfalls of cash, but also have a knack for discovering strange occult mysteries and objects in their journeys and quests. Your family likely doesn’t approve of your choice, especially if they expected you to follow a tradition or cashed in favors to secure your apprenticeship. Alternatively, you might still be trying to juggle two worlds and still work at your “day job,” in which case you might have even been given a small room in the back of the shop as your own to stay in. Regardless, your work as an apprentice has earned you a lot of good favor with the Sandpoint Mercantile League—favor that’s resulted in a growing animosity from the League’s local competitor, the Scarnetti Consortium.</p>\n  <p>Choose two ability boosts.

This has likely strained relationships with your family and some friends, but is just as likely to have helped new friendships and relationships form. Whether or not those new associations are ultimately healthy, time will tell. Your childhood veered more toward pranks and minor crimes; if you were involved in a more serious crime you (so far) have avoided being caught for it, perhaps in part due to your quick wit. You know about Sandpoint’s local criminal gang, the Bunyip Club and, while you’re not officially a part of the group yet, they’ve taken notice of you—as has the town watch, unfortunately!</p>\n  <p>Traditionally, you might have family in town, but chances are that you’re estranged with some or all of them, and either lived on your own in a rented room in the southern part of town, or in abandoned buildings or alleys using your Society skill to Subsist. Ever since you’ve started to adventure, you’ve likely been living in a long-term rental at one of Sandpoint’s inns, or perhaps have arranged accommodations at a fellow party member’s home. Joining the adventuring party made sense, since it’s a great way to make money fast—provided you can stay alive.</p>\n  <p>Choose two ability boosts.

You might even be part of one of the many caravans of journeying Varisians who often pass through town during their travels. Regardless, your fondness for the climate, the terrain, the lifestyle, and the wonder of the Lost Coast suffuses your very bones, and at times you feel almost as if you were a fundamental part of the land itself.</p>\n  <p>You might have family ties to one of Sandpoint’s original founding families, which included the Kaijitsus, the Valdemars, the Scarnettis, and the Deverins, although others were involved as well. Conversely, you might have family ties to the indigenous Varisians who have long regarded this part of the Lost Coast as home and who were part of the original accord with the Sandpoint Mercantile Guild that ensured Varisians a place in town and the opportunity to profit from Sandpoint’s success. As such, your home might be anywhere in Sandpoint, and could well be one of its larger buildings if your family has dwelled in town for long enough.</p>\n  <p>Choose two ability boosts.

This is more than enough for most days in town, where the most dangerous things one might face on a typical day are a tavern scuffle, a pet stuck on a roof, or a minor public disturbance arising from a trivial altercation between neighbors. But if townsfolk have learned anything from the past two decades, it’s that the town’s relative peace can be shattered at any moment by goblins, giants, dragons, disasters, murderers, or more!</p>\n  <p>Sandpoint’s come to rely on two additional forms of defense as a result, and the first of those is one you’ve belonged to since you could properly wield a weapon—the Sandpoint Militia. You grew up on Sandpoint’s waterfront, perhaps the child of a fisher, sailor, or shipwright, and whether or not your parents approved of your choice to turn away from the sea to join the militia, you know it was the right choice. As a militia member, your duties were to help patrol the city, report suspicious activities, and help to deal with minor events or petty crimes before they have a chance to escalate. Your knack at tricking suspects into revealing their falsehoods, your knowledge about sailing and boats, and your connections on the town’s waterfront quickly made you a valued member of the militia whenever help was needed down along the docks—even if this earned you a disparaging nickname or two from petty criminals associated with the Bunyip Club!</p>\n  <p>Whether or not you were involved in a major event over the past several years of your life or if your time as a militia member was relatively unremarkable, you’ve more recently joined the second line of the town’s defense as an adventurer. When things get out of control and exceed the capacity of the town guard to deal with, local adventurers have stepped in to save Sandpoint time and time again and, by joining your group, you stand ready to serve in that capacity the next time ghouls, giants, or worse come to town!</p>\n  <p>As with most militia members, you likely are a lifelong resident of Sandpoint.

It could be that you’ve only just arrived in town in the past few weeks, or you might have moved here months or even years ago but have continually struggled to find a place to fit in with the locals. It doesn’t help that you’ve been targeted often by allies of the Scarnetti family with offers of employment, support, or perhaps even friendship. Whether you’ve accepted these offers, or you’ve realized that the local aristocrats focus on new arrivals due to their increasingly sour reputation among most of the townsfolk, people have noticed. You haven’t done anything yet to annoy the Scarnettis (that they’ve realized, at least), but many of the locals don’t trust you and might even think of you as a Scarnetti snitch or patsy.</p>\n  <p>While your reasons for coming to Sandpoint are up to you, they should have something to do with your curiosity about the town, the Lost Coast, ancient Thassilon, the history of the Varisian lifestyle, or anything that might draw you to the region. You don’t yet own your own home in town and aren’t sure you ever will, since once you’ve completed your research you might not intend to stay in Sandpoint. You might have accepted an offer from a Scarnetti ally who had a room to let in their home (or nearby shed), could be paying for a room at one of the town’s inns, or might be relying on one of your few non-Scarnetti friends in town for a place to stay. This could be one of your fellow PCs, or it might be someone in town whose place has a small library, such as Veznutt Parooh of The Way North, Brodert Quink (Sandpoint’s oldest sage), Jabyl Sorn of the House of Blue Stones, or even Ilsoari Gandethus of Turandarok Academy.</p>\n  <p>Joining this adventuring group may have been a calculated move, a spur-of-the-moment choice, or because someone in the group is an old friend, but it’s given you a bit more security and peace of mind.

The towering monoliths and intimidating ruins, such as the immense ruined bridge extending from Magnimar, the strange rune-carved arch over Riddleport, or the partially collapsed tower here in Sandpoint known as the Old Light were sources of countless rumors, but were also held in such suspicious dread that they were rarely explored. When Runelord Karzoug woke from his slumber, though, and a now-legendary band of adventurers explored many Thassilonian ruins during their campaign against him, word of Thassilon spread like wildfire. Adventurers from across the Inner Sea region flocked to Varisia. Whether or not that had a hand in the increasing number of perils rising from old Thassilon or if that was just a coincidence, none can deny that today Thassilon is back, the runelords are either truly dead or returned to life, and the ancient empire’s ruins are ripe for research.</p>\n  <p>As a local, you’ve been equally inspired and intrigued by stories of adventurers who explore these dangerous ruins, be they Sandpoint’s own heroes or others who have explored more distant mysteries like Hollow Mountain, the Lady’s Light, or Guiltspur. You hope one day to rediscover a Thassilonian ruin that’s not yet been fully explored, but you also know that such pursuits are dangerous. Here in Sandpoint, a group called the Runewatchers has dedicated their resources to the research of Thassilon and their runelords, but while you’ve spoken with them many times, they’ve yet to fully accept you into their circle. And so you sought out the adventuring party you now belong to. With their aid, you hope to make some discoveries to truly impress the Runewatchers, but also are simply eager to sate your own curiosity about ancient Thassilon and the runelords who once ruled it.</p>\n  <p>Your home in Sandpoint is modest, and likely cluttered with books and research materials or strange ruined objects that could be junk or ancient Thassilonian treasures. Your family might support your passion, or it could be a source of contention that’s forced you to seek your own accommodations elsewhere in town. Many villagers look askance at your obsession with forces that have brought peril and ruin to Sandpoint. No matter what you’ve said to allay their fears, plenty of folks in town worry that you might dig up something that everyone in Sandpoint will come to regret.</p>\n  <p>Choose two ability boosts.

When locals were hired to help rebuild the Scarnetti manor after the giant raid on Sandpoint 17 some years ago, rumors about the family’s shady deals with local criminals associated with the Bunyip Club began to spread. While no hard evidence ever came to light, those associated with the Bunyip Club cut ties and Titus Scarnetti had to spend years trying to rebuild the family reputation while also replenishing the family treasury after rebuilding their ostentatious cliffside mansion. With the Varisian Compact coming up for renewal, old wounds have resurfaced as well; people haven’t forgotten the actions of Alamon Scarnetti, who nearly destroyed Sandpoint before it was born when he led a drunken raid against local Varisians after diplomatic discussions became strained.</p>\n  <p>Your relationship with the Scarnettis has ensured you’re part of all of this, like it or not. You don’t bear the family name, but you might be a distant relation from Riddleport or Magnimar hoping for a new chance at life. You could be a petty criminal whose fines were paid by the Scarnettis in return for a promise of service for several months or years. You might even admire the family’s tenacity and see in the Scarnettis a chance for your own fortune. The majority of your work for them has either been at one of the family’s mills (the Sandpoint Lumber Mill or the Scarnetti Mill), or as one of their agents and “watchdogs” at another business in town, where you were expected to keep an eye out for rumors and opportunities that the family could benefit from. Your knack at making lies seem like compliments helped you excel in this role, and while the Scarnettis do seem to appreciate your apparent loyalty (or at least the services you’ve provided in the past), they haven’t yet fully embraced you into their circle. Whether that’s something you want or seek to escape from, you can’t ignore the fact that your reputation as a Scarnetti ally has tarnished your standing with the Sandpoint Cathedral, simply as a side effect of the growing animosity between the two factions.</p>\n  <p>Your home might be with your family, or you could have been staying in a room rented to you at a discount (or perhaps even free of charge) from the Scarnettis, but those accommodations have recently come to an end. Joining this new adventuring group gives you an opportunity to make some of your own money, perhaps get out from under the Scarnettis’ shadow, or might even be the leverage you hope to build to finally earn old Titus’s approval.</p>\n  <p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n  <p>You’re trained in the Intimidation skill and the Mercantile Lore skill.

Some of these locations and NPCs have minor roles in Seven Dooms for Sandpoint, while a few of them will play major roles—you’ll need to play the adventure itself to find out more, though!</p>\n<p><i>Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast</i> is an excellent resource for GMs who wish to breathe more life into Sandpoint, but players should refrain from referencing this book if they intend to play in this Adventure Path. However, a few of the details in <i>Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast</i> are deliberately changed in this Adventure Path, so even if you have read this book before, you won’t know all of the secrets and plot twists ahead. Some of them might be deliberately different than you expect in this case, while others are brand new to this adventure.</p>\n<p>Although the people of Sandpoint are a friendly and welcoming group overall, as with all settlements and societies there are elements of unpleasantness, some dating all the way back to Sandpoint’s foundation in 4666 ar. The four founding families (a group called the Sandpoint Mercantile League that included the Kaijitsus, the Valdemars, the Scarnettis, and the Deverins) chose a sheltered cove some 50 miles north of their hometown of Magnimar to settle, only to find the site already claimed by local Varisians, who used the cove as a traditional waypoint during their travels along the Lost Coast. Initial attempts to work with the Varisians to ensure they would retain a place in the town-to-be collapsed when Alamon Scarnetti led several of his kin in a drunken attempt to murder the Varisians and blame the slaughter on local goblins. The attack backfired horribly, with more Scarnettis slain than Varisians, and in the months that followed it seemed that the dream of Sandpoint was done for as Magnimar’s Varisian Council demanded punishment for all members of the Sandpoint Mercantile Guild.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the remarkable diplomatic skills of a young bard named Almah Deverin, the two groups reached a peaceful accord. Not only did Almah manage to assuage the Varisians’ call for blood payment, but she also salvaged the plans for Sandpoint by promising to incorporate the worship of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.JgqH3BhuEuA4Zyqs]{Desna} into the town’s cathedral and offered the Varisian Council a generous share of all profits made by Sandpoint-based ventures for the next four decades. Salvaged from the near disaster, Sandpoint went on to become a thriving community, and Sandpoint’s government elected to extend the compact for another 20 years—much to the consternation of a few locals. Now, with this extension due to expire in a mere two years, the Scarnettis and their allies have already started work on ensuring that this “unfair allocation of profits” won’t last beyond 60 years.</p>\n<p>In those 60 years, and despite the intolerances clung to by a minority of Sandpoint’s citizens, the town grew into a thriving and welcoming settlement. The lumber and fishing industries boomed, becoming the town’s most profitable exports, while local farms helped to ensure self-sufficiency. Yet while blatant racism and willful hate seemed to be limited to only a few in scope, greater tragedies struck the town over the past two decades: an infamous pattern killer’s murderous spree; the Sandpoint Cathedral fire; goblin raids; giant and dragon attacks; a sinkhole that opened in the middle of town; tsunamis; and the regional horrors unleashed by Runelord Alaznist. These events have left the people of Sandpoint wondering if their home has become cursed—or is perhaps even doomed.</p>\n<p>What none yet realize is that there’s not just one doom in Sandpoint’s future, but seven!</p>\n<section class=\"action\">\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span class=\"keepme\">Sandpoint</span>Settlement 4</h2>\n  <ul class=\"traits\">\n    <li class=\"trait alignment\">NG</li>\n    <li class=\"trait size\">Town</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Diverse coastal town caught in the middle of sinister plots</p>\n  <p>Government Mayor (elected leader)</p>\n  <p>Population 1,240 (89% humans, 3% halflings, 2% elves, 2% dwarves, 1% gnomes, 1% half-elves, 1% half-orcs, 0.5% goblins, 0.5% other)</p>\n  <p>Languages Common, Shoanti, Varisian</p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Religions @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.d56paSkcwvll2OhR]{Abadar}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.AlL9GtlTldbqNoVm]{Calistria}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.JgqH3BhuEuA4Zyqs]{Desna}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.mm1j6UbHqFCI8fwB]{Erastil}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.swwwP7eVmlNuWTb7]{Gozreh}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.BNycwu3I21dTh4D9]{Sarenrae}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.gxwmzxUWBOhdgFSN]{Shelyn}</p>\n  <p>Threats ancient hidden dangers, criminals, ghouls, goblins</p>\n  <p>Quick to Chat The majority of Sandpoint’s citizens are eager to gossip and spread news.

              "text": "<h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Sandpoint Factions\">Sandpoint Factions</h2>\n<p>\n  Power shifts over time in any community. Currently, seven distinct factions hold most of the influence in Sandpoint.\n  Some of these have held power since the town’s foundation, while others are brand new to the political scene.\n  Traditionally, power in Sandpoint has resided among its four founding families, but with the Kaijitsus and the\n  Valdemars having turned their attentions elsewhere, and the Scarnettis only now emerging from a bevy of legal issues,\n  political power in Sandpoint has moved away from a faux aristocracy toward a larger set of factions representing a\n  wider and more accurate view of the town’s interests. Each of these factions represent groups with which your\n  characters can build reputation, but as ever in matters political, earning favor with one faction can earn the hatred\n  of another.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Bunyip Club:</strong> This group consists of an organized band of criminals led by Jubrayl Vhiski and is the\n  closest thing in Sandpoint to a thieves’ guild. Their members rarely engage in violent crime, and while their actions\n  in town are more of a nuisance than a threat, rumors say that the Bunyip Club holds more power over Sandpoint than\n  anyone expects. The Bunyip Club allegedly keeps a secret hideout somewhere in the old smuggling tunnels below\n  Sandpoint.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Runewatchers:</strong> The newest group to rise to power are the loosely affiliated Runewatchers. Ever since\n  Thassilon’s legacy leapt to the forefront of Varisia’s international reputation (triggered in no small part to events\n  that took place right here in town 17 years prior), the Runewatchers have collected lore and tales about old Thassilon\n  while also keeping an eye out for new problems associated with the ancient nation’s legacy. The Runewatchers meet on\n  the first day of each season at Brodert Quink’s home (area S8) to share rumors and news, though these gatherings have\n  mostly become glorified social visits of late.\n</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 ABSTALAR ZANTUS.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 ABSTALAR ZANTUS.webp')\" />\n<p>\n  <strong>Sandpoint Cathedral:</strong> Sandpoint’s current religious leader is Abstalar Zantus, an elderly man who,\n  it’s rumored, is eager to retire and pass the proverbial torch to a new priest. The cathedral itself is the largest\n  building in town (area S1).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Sandpoint Mercantile League:</strong> The oldest faction in town is the Sandpoint Mercantile League.\n  Originally formed by the town’s four founding families, the Mercantile League today counts most of Sandpoint’s\n  merchants, innkeepers, and providers among its number. The Sandpoint Mercantile League bases its operations out of a\n  large building near the town’s waterfront (area S40).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Scarnetti Consortium:</strong> After several brushes with legal trouble, local businessman and aristocrat\n  Titus Scarnetti consolidated and rebuilt his holdings into the Scarnetti Consortium. With the retreat of the Valdemars\n  from town, the Scarnettis have bolstered their presence in Sandpoint’s industries, and today the Consortium is the\n  greatest rival to the long-established Mercantile League. The Scarnetti Consortium is run by the Scarnettis themselves\n  from their manor (area S48).\n</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 KENDRA DEVERIN.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 KENDRA DEVERIN.webp')\" />\n<p>\n  <strong>Town Watch:</strong> Sheriff Belor Hemlock continues to command the town watch, although he’s increasingly\n  relied upon the assistance of his wife Kaye Tesarani to handle the delicate matters of politics and public relations.\n  The town watch patrols both the settlement’s streets and the roads through its hinterlands, and are responsible for\n  the safety of the citizens. The town watch is based out of the Sandpoint Garrison (area S10).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Townsfolk:</strong> Finally, there are the townsfolk themselves, ably represented by their mayor, Kendra\n  Deverin. Kendra keeps a manor to the south of town, but the business of running Sandpoint and seeing to the needs of\n  its people is focused in the town hall (area S11).\n</p>"

If you chose one of the backgrounds created for Seven Dooms for Sandpoint, you’ll have been given some advice on where your home might be in town. Work with your GM to decide where your character lives, if they have family in town, and whether they own their own home—potentially choosing from one of the many unlabeled buildings on the town’s map. Homeless PCs can always attempt to Subsist in the alleys (with a @Check[society|dc:13|traits:action:subsist,downtime] check), by hiding in a Hazard location (with a @Check[stealth|dc:15|traits:action:hide,secret] check), or by camping in the immediate hinterlands (with a @Check[survival|dc:17] check).</p>\n<h3 data-split-here=\"Earning Income\">Earning Income</h3>\n<p>While it’s expected that your characters’ primary source of income during this Adventure Path is adventuring, there’s plenty of opportunity to augment wallets and coffers during downtime via Earning Income. Any PC can attempt to Earn Income in Sandpoint by attempting a Crafting, Lore, or Performance check, but the maximum Task Level that can normally be attempted in town is equal to that of Sandpoint’s level: 4.</p>\n<p>A shady PC can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.QyzlsLrqM0EEwd7j]{Earn Income} through petty crime such as pickpocketing, running con games, or even minor burglaries, but without support from the Bunyip Club, a freelance criminal in Sandpoint runs a greater risk of punishment. As with other methods, unsupported Thievery in town is limited to a maximum Task Level of 4. If a PC fails at an attempt to Earn Income with Thievery, they can abandon any payment they would have earned from the failure to escape repercussions, otherwise they’re caught in the act (a critical failure guarantees being caught). Each time a PC is caught during freelance Thievery, the party loses [[/r 1d4 #Reputation Points]] Reputation Points from every faction. For minor crimes, the PC is expected to return all stolen property and pay a fine to the town equal to twice the value of the property they stole or face a number of days in jail in the garrison (area S10). An agent of the Bunyip Club is likely to approach a captured PC to offer them a chance at freedom if they join the Club—see Earning Reputation below.</p>\n<p>Earning the support of an NPC who lives at an Employer location (see Earning Support below) often allows a PC to use other skills to Earn Income, or unlocks higher Task Levels to pursue.</p>\n<h3 data-split-here=\"Earning Reputation\">Earning Reputation</h3>\n<p>As your party spends time in Sandpoint, they’ll earn Reputation among the town’s seven most influential factions. Each of these factions represents one of the seven seats on the Town Council; the factions themselves are summarized further below.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 BELOR HEMLOCK.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO90200 BELOR HEMLOCK.webp')\" />\n<p>Reputation in Sandpoint is tracked using the rules presented on pages 164–165 of the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide. While individual PC actions (up to and including ramifications from your background) can adjust reputation, the party earns reputation for these seven factions as a group, not as individual PCs. The GM should keep track of the PCs’ current reputation category and current Reputation Points publicly, so you’ll always know where the group stands with the seven factions.</p>\n<p>The GM has information about the party’s starting Reputation and point value for each faction, along with any advantages and disadvantages for each tier of reputation. A full list of Sandpoint’s factions appears above.</p>\n<h3 data-split-here=\"Earning Support\">Earning Support</h3>\n<p>It’s possible to build relationships with important individuals in Sandpoint as well as with the town’s factions. By adjusting a key NPC’s attitude condition to helpful, that NPC’s location supports the party in certain exploration and downtime activities. There’s no limit to the number of locations that can support the party; once a PC gains the support of a location, they retain it until significant events say otherwise.</p>\n<p>Some locations allow certain types of characters to retrain efficiently once they’ve made that location’s NPC Helpful. In such a location, retraining that would normally require a week takes only 5 days, retraining that would normally require a month takes only 3 weeks, and the retraining itself is generally free.</p>\n<p>Every location’s first tag indicates what faction it belongs to. The first time anyone in the party earns the support of a location, the party increases their Reputation Points with that faction by 1, unless they are already Admired (or better) or Hated (or worse), in which case no Reputation Points are earned.</p>\n<h3 data-split-here=\"Benefits of Support\">Benefits of Support</h3>\n<p>If you gain the support of a location, the entire party earns benefits based on that location’s traits, as detailed below. (Note that some locations offer additional hidden benefits; your GM will reveal these benefits as opportunities arise during play.)</p>\n<p><strong>Criminal:</strong> Characters who focus on criminal activities can retrain efficiently at this location. A PC who uses Underworld Lore to Earn Income gains a +1 circumstance bonus on the check. A PC can use Thievery to Earn Income here, but a critical failure on this check may result in legal action or possible imprisonment.</p>\n<p><strong>Employer:</strong> The location offers tasks up to its level for PCs to Earn Income using Crafting (to craft items associated with the location) or any of the skills mentioned in the entry once it supports the PCs.</p>\n<p><strong>Garrison:</strong> Martially inclined characters can retrain efficiently here. On-site @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.plBGdZhqq5JBl1D8]{Gather Information} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1kGNdIIhuglAjIp9]{Treat Wounds} checks gain a +1 circumstance bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Hazard:</strong> The site offers dangers of the GM’s design. Despite the risks, hazards can serve as places to hide out, as they are not often traveled by locals. A PC can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.49y9Ec4bDii8pcD3]{Subsist} at a Hazard site with a @Check[stealth|dc:15|traits:action:subsist,downtime] check.</p>\n<p><strong>Housing:</strong> The location offers supported PCs a 10% discount for accommodations (in the case of a commercial operation) or a comfortable living at no charge (in the case of a poorhouse or similar location).</p>\n<p><strong>Library:</strong> Scholastic-themed PCs, as well as arcane and occult spellcasters, can retrain efficiently at a library.

On-site @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.eReSHVEPCsdkSL4G]{Identify Magic} or Subsist checks gain a +1 circumstance bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Merchant:</strong> A PC can sell goods for 55% of their value, instead of half, to a Helpful NPC merchant. All items for sale and services provided at this location are discounted by 5%.</p>\n<p><strong>Municipal:</strong> If a PC secures the friendship of a Helpful NPC at a municipal site, they’ve earned the support of one of Sandpoint’s leaders. A PC can “cash in” a favor with a Helpful NPC at such a site to help with all sorts of other problems, such as avoiding a jail sentence or fine, securing access to a restricted location, or learning a closely guarded secret. The exact nature and magnitude of the favor is left to the GM to adjudicate, but once the favor is granted, that NPC cannot be called upon for another favor for some time (typically one year, but this duration can shift as the GM sees fit to match the scope of the favor).</p>\n<p><strong>Parlor:</strong> Socially inclined and skill-focused PCs can retrain more efficiently here. On-site Gather Information or Performance checks (to Earn Income) gain a +1 circumstance bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Residence:</strong> Earning the support of an NPC at a residence grants the PCs a specific and unique benefit associated with that NPC; your GM has more information on this benefit and will reveal it when support is earned.</p>\n<p><strong>Restaurant:</strong> The allied NPC helps to keep the PC fed, granting a +1 circumstance bonus on Society checks made to Subsist. The PC also becomes a well-known regular of the restaurant, and gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Gather Information attempts made therein.</p>\n<p><strong>Temple:</strong> Faithful PCs whose beliefs align with those of the temple can use a temple to retrain efficiently. Checks to Identify Magic, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1kGNdIIhuglAjIp9]{Treat Wounds}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.TC7OcDa7JlWbqMaN]{Treat Disease} on-site gain a +1 circumstance bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Venue:</strong> Bards and PCs who thrive on public performances can use venues to retrain efficiently, and attempts to Earn Income with Performance checks gain a +1 circumstance bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Workshop:</strong> A supported PC may utilize the location’s workshop and resources to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.rmwa3OyhTZ2i2AHl]{Craft} relevant items, and gains a +1 item bonus on all associated Crafting checks.</p>"

It’s best to go through the following steps as a group, reading the text aloud, making\n  decisions as a group, navigating Obstacles together, and gaining treasures and gold. You’ll level up three times\n  during this process, ending your first adventure at 4th level with a customized history that explains who you are in\n  Sandpoint and why Abstalar calls upon you at the start of <em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em>. While you can go through\n  these choices as a group without a GM, it’s best to do so in your GM’s presence so they can learn who your characters\n  are and where they’re from at the same time you do, and so they can step in to make narrative changes to the following\n  text if they wish to further customize this experience to your group.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each PC begins this adventure with 1 Hero Point. While death isn’t a concern in the following interactive text, you\n  may wish to spend a Hero Point to reroll a failed skill check. You can regain Hero Points only after being defeated in\n  an Obstacle; this represents the tides of fate, having turned against you, bolstering you in the future (and helps to\n  prevent groups from being defeated too often!).\n</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Obstacles</h1>\n  <p>\n    The actual adventures your group takes part in are represented here as Obstacles. These are a chance to earn Victory\n    Points and extra treasure by using one of three checks to overcome the Obstacle, as described in the text’s entry.\n    At an Obstacle, each PC must attempt one of these three checks to earn Victory Points according to the following\n    results.\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The PCs gain 2 Victory Points.</p>\n  <p><strong>Success</strong> The PCs gain 1 Victory Point.</p>\n  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The PCs lose 1 Victory Point.</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Triumph:</strong> To overcome the Obstacle, your group must accumulate a total number of Victory Points\n    equal to the number of players – 1.

Proceed to the Triumph entry.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Defeat:</strong> If you fail to overcome the Obstacle, your group fails at their adventure. This does not\n    equate to a total party kill, though! Instead, you’ll be rescued or otherwise escape from the situation; you’ll earn\n    fewer rewards, but each PC will earn a Hero Point to help them in the next Obstacle.

While they were\n    obviously eager to travel to the site and explore it now that you’d established an understanding with those dwelling\n    above, within, and below, they didn’t forget to pay you well. Still, the identity of whoever hired those rival\n    adventurers to search the laboratory for samples of strange, rare fungal ingredients and alchemical lore for “the\n    distillation of dreams” worries you. Someone in Sandpoint is up to something, and if your actions below the Three\n    Cormorants didn’t totally disrupt their plans, you’re at least hopeful they’ve delayed them long enough for\n    someone—perhaps even your group—to learn more!\n  </p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>\n    <strong>Reward:</strong> Between the reward paid to your group by the Runewatchers and the items and treasures you\n    discovered in the dungeon itself, your group made a tidy profit from this latest adventure.\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-indent:2ch\" class=\"no-indent\">Each PC selects one of the following as a reward:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>A wand of any common 1st-level spell</li>\n    <li>Any common worn magic item of 3rd level or lower</li>\n    <li>\n      A formula for any 3rd-level or lower magical tattoo (<span>Treasure Vault</span> 119–123) or two scrolls\n      containing an uncommon 2nd- or lower-level spell (subject to GM approval)\n    </li>\n    <li>Any combination of 3 common 4th-level or lower alchemical consumables</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p style=\"text-indent:2ch\" class=\"no-indent\">\n    Each PC also gains a common weapon of their choice (choosing from a <span>+1 weapon</span>, a low-grade cold iron\n    weapon, or a low-grade silver weapon) and 30 gp—payments from grateful Runewatchers eager to dig into the\n    information you brought back for them.\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-indent:2ch\" class=\"no-indent\">Increase the party’s reputation with the Runewatchers by 1.</p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>\n    <strong>The party advances to 4th level! </strong>Go to\n    @UUID[.16yourfirstadv00#an-invitation-from-abstalarentry-25]{Entry 25}.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"split\">In Over Your Heads!<span class=\"keepme\">Entry 20</span></h2>\n  <hr />\n  <p class=\"no-indent\">\n    The harpies who rule the Three Cormorants gave you a fair bit of trouble, and perhaps you should have taken that\n    struggle to heart before pressing on into the dungeons below. It was obvious that a rival group had already entered\n    the complex, but when they ambushed your group, things quickly turned bad—especially when the conflict released an\n    ancient alchemical abomination that slaughtered the rival group and nearly did you in as well! It was more luck than\n    skill that enabled your group’s panicked escape from the dungeon before you could properly explore its secrets.\n  </p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>\n    <strong>Reward:</strong> The repercussions of your failure in the ancient alchemy lab are unfortunate, but what bits\n    of lore you managed to discover are better than nothing. Between what minor treasures you were able to scavenge and\n    the pittance paid to you by the Runewatchers, you each earn 30 gp.\n  </p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>\n    <strong>The party advances to 4th level!</strong> Go to\n    @UUID[.16yourfirstadv00#an-invitation-from-abstalarentry-25]{Entry 25}.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"split\">The Devil’s Disciples<span class=\"keepme\">Entry 21</span></h2>\n  <p class=\"no-indent\">\n    Finding the old smuggler’s den was somewhat tricky, but your group had the foresight to approach early in the\n    morning during low tide, giving you the advantage of the pre-dawn shadows and an easier time navigating the narrow\n    beaches at the base of the coastal cliffs. You caught some of the squatters by surprise and, either by eavesdropping\n    or interrogating them, you learned the group called themselves the Devil’s Disciples—a sort of secret society\n    following a nameless leader who believed that the Sandpoint Devil was on the verge of becoming a god.\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-indent:2ch\" class=\"no-indent\">\n    While it would soon become clear that the disciples who dwelled in this cave were the society’s lowest-ranking\n    members, they were nonetheless fervent in their belief and deadly with their machetes. With hell hounds, an allied\n    ogre, and (ironically) an actual bunyip to bolster their numbers, the Devil’s Disciples put up quite a fight before\n    they were defeated. Their leaders are still out there, so you made sure to leave no clues behind as to who swept in\n    and took this group out. Whether or not their beliefs about the Sandpoint Devil are true, though, who can say?\n  </p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>\n    <strong>Reward:</strong> The Devil’s Disciples were relatively well equipped, in part from scavenging the supplies\n    left behind by the Bunyip Club.

The rocky beaches along the coast east of town aren’t easy\n    to navigate, especially at high tide, and the coastal cliffs make approaching from land dangerous. Things didn’t get\n    easier once you found the cave, for the troublemaking squatters turned out to be far more organized and dangerous\n    than you expected. Initial conflicts against them made it clear that the group was some sort of secret society that\n    worshipped the Sandpoint Devil, but when the group brought out their fire-breathing hounds, your group had to admit\n    defeat and flee the scene. Gressel wasn’t happy to hear of your failure and didn’t pay you a thing.\n  </p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>\n    <strong>Reward:</strong> While the Bunyip Club didn’t pay you for your failure, you did manage to scrape together a\n    bit of coin and snatch some trinkets from the smuggler’s den before you had to flee.

With its windows boarded up\n    and entrances locked tight, the building has descended over the years into a sort of social shadow. People pass by\n    on the street without giving it a second thought during the day, while after dark, glimpses of strange lights or\n    eerie sounds keep the curious away.\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-indent:2ch\" class=\"no-indent\">\n    Using a key provided by the Sandpoint Mercantile League, entering the abandoned glassworks was a simple matter, but\n    as you explored the stone building, it quickly became apparent that exorcising its spirits would be anything but.\n    Malevolent hauntings attempted to lay you low: bleeding beds that lure you to sleep only to inflict nightmares of\n    being stabbed to death, sweeping and overwhelming bouts of shame that attempt to leave you helpless, and a deadly\n    furnace prone to belching out gouts of shrieking fire were some of the sinister manifestations you encountered,\n    while elsewhere, shades of undead goblins—spirits who became trapped in the glassworks when the town was invaded 17\n    years ago—sapped your strength. But the greatest threat of all was the enraged ghost of Lonjiku Kaijitsu himself,\n    who manifested from a pile of glass fragments that once encased his corpse. The ghost was horrific indeed, his limbs\n    blackened and pierced with shards of glass, his face but a skull lit from within by fire, his shadow a choking cloud\n    of soot.\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-indent:2ch\" class=\"no-indent\">\n    Putting Lonjiku to rest required more than defeating him in combat. You had to scour the building for every shard\n    from the shattered cocoon of glass he died within, clean them with holy water, and then bury them in a grave at the\n    Sandpoint Boneyard. Once you did so, his ghost moved on, and without its influence, the remaining fell influences in\n    the building faded with the next sunrise.\n  </p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>\n    <strong>Reward:</strong> The glassworks itself had very little in the way of treasure to be discovered, but the\n    Sandpoint Mercantile League was more than generous in rewarding you for exorcising the building so that it could be\n    restored to use.\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-indent:2ch\" class=\"no-indent\">Each PC selects one of the following as a reward:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>A wand of any common 1st-level spell</li>\n    <li>Any common worn magic item of 3rd level or lower</li>\n    <li>A <span>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.3vxoffA4slKHXtj2]{Channel Protection Amulet}</span></li>\n    <li>Any combination of 3 common 4th-level or lower elixirs or potions</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p style=\"text-indent:2ch\" class=\"no-indent\">\n    Each PC also gains a common weapon of their choice (choosing from a <span>+1 weapon</span>, a low-grade cold iron\n    weapon, or a low-grade silver weapon) and 30 gp—the remainder of your payment from the Sandpoint Mercantile League\n    for making the glassworks safe to reopen.\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-indent:2ch\" class=\"no-indent\">\n    Increase the party’s reputation with the Sandpoint Mercantile League by 1.\n  </p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>\n    <strong>The party advances to 4th level!</strong> Go to\n    @UUID[.16yourfirstadv00#an-invitation-from-abstalarentry-25]{Entry 25}.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"split\">Where Ghosts Rule<span class=\"keepme\">Entry 24</span></h2>\n  <hr />\n  <p class=\"no-indent\">\n    Using a key provided by the Sandpoint Mercantile League, your entrance into the Sandpoint Glassworks was quick and\n    easy. This did not last. It wasn’t long before writhing shadows of long-dead goblins rose from the ash smears on the\n    walls, chilling your souls and chasing you deeper into the haunted building. Fire spewed from furnaces, knife wounds\n    manifested without reason on your flesh, and worst of all, the burning ghost of Lonjiku himself rose up to scorch\n    you with blasts of molten glass. It was less than an hour before you somehow managed to stagger back out of the\n    building, your bodies in agony and minds reeling. The Sandpoint Mercantile League was disappointed to learn that the\n    haunting presence within was too much for you to handle, but to their credit, they did pay you for your trouble. In\n    any event, the legacy of Sandpoint’s haunted glassworks only grows in the wake of your failed attempt to exorcise\n    it.\n  </p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>\n    <strong>Reward:</strong> The Sandpoint Mercantile League pays each PC 30 gp and reevaluates their plans for the\n    building.\n  </p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>\n    <strong>The party advances to 4th level!</strong> Go to\n    @UUID[.16yourfirstadv00#an-invitation-from-abstalarentry-25]{Entry 25}.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"split\">An Invitation from Abstalar<span class=\"keepme\">Entry 25</span></h2>\n  <p class=\"no-indent\">\n    Your group has firmly established their reputation in Sandpoint as adventurers of note, even if you had a few\n    failures along the way.

              "text": "<h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here=\"What Came Before\">What Came Before</h2>\n<p>\n  Since <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i> begins with the party being 4th level, character creation is a bit more involved than\n  normal. The notes and advice on the following pages will help you create a brand new 4th-level character, while the\n  section titled “Your First Adventure” on page 28 will help you and the other players at your table work out where your\n  PCs have come from and what they accomplished before they begin this Adventure Path.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can, of course, also use existing 4th-level characters—if you do so, you’ll need to work with your GM as to why\n  you’ve all come to Sandpoint and why your group has been called upon by local cleric Abstalar Zantus to help him with\n  the situation in the local graveyard.\n</p>\n<h3 data-split-here=\"Rusthenge\">Rusthenge</h3>\n<p>\n  This standalone adventure can serve as a perfect setup for <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i>. Notes in <i>Rusthenge</i>, as well as\n  in <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i>, are available for your GM to forge a link between these two adventures. You’ll still\n  need to work with your GM for why your group’s moved on from Chakikoth Isle and the Kindred Coast featured in\n  <i>Rusthenge</i> to arrive at Sandpoint, but your characters should be precisely the level you need to be to catch Abstalar’s\n  eye and be ready to begin the Adventure Path.\n</p>\n<h3 data-split-here=\"Burnt Offerings\">Burnt Offerings</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO9425-Sandpoint Symbol.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap200-seven-dooms-for-sandpoint/assets/art/PZO9425-Sandpoint Symbol.webp');transform:rotate(-10deg)\" />\n<p>\n  One potentially unusual possibility is to use the very first Adventure Path adventure, “Burnt Offerings,” as the\n  lead-in for <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i>. As mentioned above, the plot of this Adventure Path does serve as a sort of\n  sequel for that adventure, so a group that plays through “Burnt Offerings” will not only be the proper level, but will\n  also have an investment in the town and a connection to many of the characters who play significant roles in <i>Seven\n  Dooms for Sandpoint</i>. Of course, this also assumes that those characters didn’t go on to finish the rest of Rise of the\n  Runelords, and your GM will need to update “Burnt Offerings” to work with Second Edition rules. Taken as a one-shot\n  adventure, though, “Burnt Offerings” functions quite well as a single adventure with a definitive story that comes to\n  a conclusive end, allowing you to play through this story, then have your 4th-level characters go into semi-retirement\n  for 17 years before they’re called out of retirement as <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i> begins!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i> begins 17 years after “Burnt Offerings,” you have another unique opportunity as well\n  if your fellow players and GMs are on board—you could play children of characters previously played in Rise of the\n  Runelords! If you choose this option, though, and your character’s high-level parents are still active in the world,\n  consider the points in the “Where Are the Heroes?” sidebar.\n</p>\n<h3 data-split-here=\"Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast\">Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast</h3>\n<p>\n  Another possibility is for your GM to create a bespoke adventure for you and your fellow players to go on in the town\n  of Sandpoint. The Pathfinder First Edition book <i>Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast</i> presents a wide range of potential\n  adventure seeds in town that a GM can build all manner of plot from. Note also that many of the plot elements that\n  make up <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i> itself are discussed in that book as well, so if you intend to play in this\n  Adventure Path, you should consider treating the contents of that book as spoilers. The Sandpoint gazetteer beginning\n  on page 17 of this Player’s Guide is a spoiler-free resource for players to peruse when building a local hero.\n</p>\n<h3 data-split-here=\"Brand New to Town\">Brand New to Town</h3>\n<p>\n  While <i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i> is filled with nostalgia and callbacks to previous adventures set in one of\n  Pathfinder’s oldest established towns, its story is self-contained and still provides plenty of opportunity for\n  adventure and excitement to characters (and players) who are brand new to Sandpoint!\n</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Where Are the Heroes?</h1>\n  <p><i>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</i> tells a new story for new heroes, and as such it works best if previous heroes who began their adventuring careers are no longer present in the town. If your table has retired high-level adventurers living or active in Sandpoint as part of its established canon, work with your GM to come up with a reason why those local legends are away from town for an extended period of time, leaving the task of saving Sandpoint from its latest dooms to your new group of PCs. This can be particularly challenging if you’re playing the child of one of these high-level adventurers, in which case you’ll need to come up with a reason why your parent(s) don’t just come in to do this adventure for you!</p>\n</aside>"
