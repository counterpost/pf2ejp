A creature can attempt to sever one of the hydra's heads by specifically targeting it and dealing damage equal to the head's Hit Points. A head that is not completely severed returns to full Hit Points at the end of any creature's turn. A hydra can regrow a severed head using hydra regeneration. A creature can prevent this regrowth by dealing acid or fire damage to the stump, cauterizing it. Single-target acid or fire effects need to be targeted at a specific stump, but effects that deal splash damage or affect areas covering the hydra's whole space cauterize all stumps if they deal acid or fire damage. If the attack that severs a head deals any acid or fire damage, the stump is cauterized instantly. If all ten heads are cauterized, the hydra dies.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-effects.Item.uZJOdounIHaFDC1t]{Effect: Hydra Heads}</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"cXqMaFbDAXymsdwm","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Mocking Chorus Head","sort":800000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>HP</strong> (head) 35, head regrowth</p>\n<p><strong>Immunities</strong> area damage</p>\n<p><strong>Weakness</strong> slashing 10</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"GMRmXeCJtb4dfXpG","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Actor.FUnnTzkARhfNi5cP.Item.PjV6SBjIY1Ge7WUB"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Reactive Heads","sort":900000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>A hydra gains an extra reaction per round for each of its heads beyond the first, which it can use only to make Reactive Strikes.
