Guardian nagas believe that the beautiful elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to such a grand effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with similar values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors and to exchange knowledge of the heavens.</p>\n<p>Guardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood, to depart the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to protect. Sometimes generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place, passing the honor of such care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent nagas aim to have at least one of their children elect to stay behind and become the guardian of their ancestral ward, giving the parents the peace of mind that the site they protect will continue to be guarded by their descendants.</p>\n<p>It is difficult for many societies that vilify serpents or see them as symbols of evil to accept the fact that guardian nagas are benevolent and kindly. Fortunately for these people, guardian nagas are also patient and understanding, and see encounters with such societies as opportunities to educate and expand worldviews.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nagas are serpentine beings with magical powers and keen, nearly inscrutable intellects. Physically, they resemble massive snakes with eerie visages that resemble those of humans. Nagas use their innate magic and poisonous fangs to keep all but the most stalwart foes at bay. Beyond the natural weapons they use to ward away foes, little is understood of the naga's unsettling physiology.</p>\n<p>Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society-an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.</p>\n<p>Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins. In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be worshipped as gods.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-18: Equal Exchanges-Tapestry of the Mind"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":26,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":24},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":25},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":26}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":27},"deception":{"base":23},"diplomacy":{"base":26},"stealth":{"base":25}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["aberration","good","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-5-bestiary.Actor.05Vy7mpQdzAs55rh"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"0BWqVxX1osDP2C8n","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","items":[{"_id":"9egAGWjwUU5RzRpl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Mineral Glaze","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An unattended inanimate object enters the path of the calcite flow</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The object gains a thin shell of calcite.

This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the deceased creature's brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the corpse's mouth to drink blood from its victims.</p>\n<p>A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie finds a secluded place to vomit forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the corpse as its first meal.</p>\n<p>The name \"void zombie\" is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien, not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies, has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other names. Suggestions have included \"void dead,\" \"akata spawn,\" or \"bloodwalker,\" but the visceral and compelling commonplace name has proven difficult to shed.</p>\n<p>The driving force behind a void zombie's violence rises from the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best, one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two- after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic outside force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly violent when encountering a yellow musk thrall, making direct comparisons of the two creatures particularly difficult, or even dangerous.

Their eyes glow with ghastly green light, and rotting seaweed, barnacles, and dead sea creatures cling to their bodies. Draugr can't speak, but expresses their malicious emotions with gurgles, as though they were eternally drowning with lungs full of water. They desire little more than to attack living creatures, especially those who sail the sea. Even when they go upon land, draugrs often drag the corpses of those they strike down back to the water, populating the depths with even more dead.</p>\n<p>Draugr rise in the haunted places of the sea, where restless spirits, swells of void energy, or supernatural storms deliver death. A corpse might rest at the bottom of the sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, a corpse becomes increasingly disgusting before it finally rises. Proximity to intelligent life can expedite this process, and an underwater explorer who happens upon a shipwreck might cause a body to snap to unlife as a draugr suddenly. The creatures don't take intrusions lightly, especially upon their place of death.</p>\n<p>Though steeped in evil, draugr are susceptible to reminders of their lives as mariners. In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment. The creatures have even been witnessed moaning along, unable to sing the words but providing haunting accompaniment. The lull rarely lasts long, though, as the beauty of the song quickly becomes a reminder of the tragedy that befell the draugr, reaffirming their desire for blood and death.</p>\n<p>More powerful draugr with burning red eyes are called draugr captains.

A corpse might rest at the bottom of the sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, a corpse becomes increasingly disgusting before it finally rises.

This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the deceased creature's brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the corpse's mouth to drink blood from its victims.</p>\n<p>A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie finds a secluded place to vomit forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the corpse as its first meal.</p>\n<p>The name \"void zombie\" is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien, not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies, has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other names. Suggestions have included \"void dead,\" \"akata spawn,\" or \"bloodwalker,\" but the visceral and compelling commonplace name has proven difficult to shed.</p>\n<p>The driving force behind a void zombie's violence rises from the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best, one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two- after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic outside force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly violent when encountering a yellow musk thrall, making direct comparisons of the two creatures particularly difficult, or even dangerous. The fact that a void zombie, unlike a yellow musk thrall, is actually undead may hold some clues as to the source of this strange behavior.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-09: Equal Exchange - Skymetal Hoard"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":5,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":5},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":7}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":6}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["undead"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-5-bestiary.Actor.MZcunXY0d99zLI1v"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"nMMRUST4ow0kcbTy","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"zc7TebSO9Nx9SI4z","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.UX71GkWBL9g41VwM"},"img":"icons/weapons/swords/greatsword-crossguard-silver.webp","name":"Greatsword","sort":100000,"system":{"baseItem":"greatsword","bonus":{"value":0},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"bulk":{"value":2},"category":"martial","containerId":null,"damage":{"damageType":"slashing","dice":1,"die":"d12"},"description":{"value":"<p>This immense two-handed sword is nearly as tall as its wielder.

A corpse might rest at the bottom of the sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, a corpse becomes increasingly disgusting before it finally rises.

In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment.

This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the deceased creature's brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the corpse's mouth to drink blood from its victims.</p>\n<p>A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie finds a secluded place to vomit forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the corpse as its first meal.</p>\n<p>The name \"void zombie\" is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien, not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies, has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other names. Suggestions have included \"void dead,\" \"akata spawn,\" or \"bloodwalker,\" but the visceral and compelling commonplace name has proven difficult to shed.</p>\n<p>The driving force behind a void zombie's violence rises from the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best, one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two- after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic outside force.

Their eyes glow with ghastly green light, and rotting seaweed, barnacles, and dead sea creatures cling to their bodies. Draugr can't speak, but expresses their malicious emotions with gurgles, as though they were eternally drowning with lungs full of water. They desire little more than to attack living creatures, especially those who sail the sea. Even when they go upon land, draugrs often drag the corpses of those they strike down back to the water, populating the depths with even more dead.</p>\n<p>Draugr rise in the haunted places of the sea, where restless spirits, swells of void energy, or supernatural storms deliver death. A corpse might rest at the bottom of the sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, a corpse becomes increasingly disgusting before it finally rises. Proximity to intelligent life can expedite this process, and an underwater explorer who happens upon a shipwreck might cause a body to snap to unlife as a draugr suddenly. The creatures don't take intrusions lightly, especially upon their place of death.</p>\n<p>Though steeped in evil, draugr are susceptible to reminders of their lives as mariners. In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment. The creatures have even been witnessed moaning along, unable to sing the words but providing haunting accompaniment. The lull rarely lasts long, though, as the beauty of the song quickly becomes a reminder of the tragedy that befell the draugr, reaffirming their desire for blood and death.</p>\n<p>More powerful draugr with burning red eyes are called draugr captains.

Guardian nagas believe that the beautiful elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to such a grand effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with similar values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors and to exchange knowledge of the heavens.</p>\n<p>Guardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood, to depart the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to protect. Sometimes generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place, passing the honor of such care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent nagas aim to have at least one of their children elect to stay behind and become the guardian of their ancestral ward, giving the parents the peace of mind that the site they protect will continue to be guarded by their descendants.</p>\n<p>It is difficult for many societies that vilify serpents or see them as symbols of evil to accept the fact that guardian nagas are benevolent and kindly. Fortunately for these people, guardian nagas are also patient and understanding, and see encounters with such societies as opportunities to educate and expand worldviews.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nagas are serpentine beings with magical powers and keen, nearly inscrutable intellects. Physically, they resemble massive snakes with eerie visages that resemble those of humans. Nagas use their innate magic and poisonous fangs to keep all but the most stalwart foes at bay. Beyond the natural weapons they use to ward away foes, little is understood of the naga's unsettling physiology.</p>\n<p>Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society-an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.</p>\n<p>Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins.

He promises to let them survive the battle and claim that they drove him away despite the deaths of their friends. Demand Pact gains the following results:</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Wanikkawi's hatred for others overcomes him. He does not treat any other creatures as allies for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature does not treat any other creature as an ally for 1 round. It doesn't become hostile but can't take an action (such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1kGNdIIhuglAjIp9]{Treat Wounds} or Aid) or cast a spell to directly benefit any creature but itself. It doesn't count as an ally for the purposes of flanking.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As above, but the creature also can't attack another creature.

Demand Pact gains the following results:</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Wanikkawi remembers his own escape and must fight against that impulse. He gains a –10 status penalty to his speed for 1 round if he's in the firelight (–20 feet in bright light from the fire).</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is fleeing for a single action on its next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is fleeing for 1 round.</p>\n<h3>Pact of Power</h3>\n<p>Wanikkawi promises power by transforming them into a spirit, like he was. Demand Pact gains the following results:</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Wanikkawi becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} at the thought of his own transformation.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes on aspects of Wanikkawi's form for 1 minute. Because of this, if they enter or begin their turn in bright light caused by the fire, they become sickened 1 for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As above, except the creature becomes sickened 1 if they enter or begin their turn in any light by the fire and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 2} in bright light caused by the fire. This condition remains for 1 minute.</p>\n<h3>Pact of Erasure</h3>\n<p>Wanikkawi threatens the PC's true story will be forgotten, as his was.
