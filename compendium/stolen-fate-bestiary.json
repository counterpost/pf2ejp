Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history-both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.</p>\n<p>After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state.</p>\n<p>For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #191: The Destiny War"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":26,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":25},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":28},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":30}},"skills":{"arcana":{"base":31},"crafting":{"base":29,"note":"can craft magic items"},"deception":{"base":29},"intimidation":{"base":27},"nature":{"base":27},"stealth":{"base":27}},"traits":{"rarity":"unique","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["evil","undead","unholy"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.stolen-fate-bestiary.Actor.25cRUcUTP3rK5qjU"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"26mSMWZwuYBRDhBM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"1P2Kly3ELf2X8jdv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaw","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["crystal-corruption"]},"bonus":{"value":24},"damageRolls":{"3h9yyad8huocrb3ey4b6":{"damage":"2d12+13","damageType":"piercing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["deadly-d10"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Ho2TRxPdMdaTfr2V","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":200000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["crystal-corruption"]},"bonus":{"value":24},"damageRolls":{"corvp630h1polw1gt4mn":{"damage":"2d8+13","damageType":"slashing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["agile"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"hbdeUFe3D16BSKa0","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.j2wsK6IsW5yMW1jW"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Tremorsense (Imprecise) 60 feet","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Tremorsense]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"},"rules":[],"slug":"tremorsense","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"VWI6L5E7GsAtSrfF","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.9qV49KjZujZnSp6w"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"All-Around Vision","sort":400000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.AllAroundVision]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"system.attributes.flanking.flankable","value":false}],"slug":"all-around-vision","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"jvmfyWcZp1aZiZqS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/TwoActions.webp","name":"Claw Frenzy","sort":500000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":2},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p>The Crystalline Sentinel makes three claw Strikes; no more than two can be against the same target.

Bhanyadas taken away from Open Bridge quickly decay into a repulsive slurry, although though it isn't clear whether their demise is due to being too far from the magical energies that animated them or too far from the masses of other bhanyadas that give them cunning and vigor.</p>\n<h3>Bhanyada Familiars</h3>\n<p>A component of a bhanyada swarm makes a useful, if gruesome, familiar. A character who can take a familiar and who has encountered a bhanyada can choose a bhanyada familiar, which must have the burrower and darkvision abilities. The owner would be wise to anoint the familiar with perfumes or find other solutions to mask the unpleasant smell.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #190: The Choosing"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":23,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":25},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":20},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":23}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":23},"survival":{"base":21}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["aberration","evil"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.stolen-fate-bestiary.Actor.eF3ndkXtyeMHpzZb"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"EkPs0okirh66YKa0","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"aLhWdKoUI0wcntZE","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":35,"value":27},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ZdEz4EIdaQhBHVLM","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Jvyy6oVIQsD34MHB"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/uncontrollable-dance.webp","name":"Uncontrollable Dance","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"will"}},"description":{"value":"<p>The target is overcome with an all-consuming urge to dance.

Some forms of <em>imprisonment</em> can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chains</strong> You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the <em>imprisonment</em> ritual's spell rank, and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.</li>\n<li><strong>Object (9th level or higher)</strong> You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can't use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also transmutation magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Oubliette (10th level only)</strong> You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can't be reached by any means. You also prevent divinations from revealing the location where the <em>imprisonment</em> occurred. Powerful magic such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish} can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even such magic can't free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4ddJSjC9Zz5DX0oG]{Freedom} ritual can do so.</li>\n<li><strong>Prison</strong> You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.</li>\n<li><strong>Slumber (sleep effect)</strong> You put the creature into an eternal sleep. It ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target-whether romantically, filially, or otherwise-frees it from the slumber. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also enchantment magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal Stasis</strong> You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends.

These tresses and full skirts in fact disguise the huldra's supernatural features: a hollow wooden back, a long bovine tail, and incredible strength.</p>\n<p>Folk legends from the lands of the north describe huldras as the creations of troll witches, intended to lure potential meals to the slaughter. Indeed, a huldra's regeneration is so similar to a troll's that a link between the two creatures seems entirely possible, but huldras despise trolls and resent tales suggesting any connection between them. Rather, huldras are wardens of the woodlands they occupy. Grown from saplings by powerful forest-dwelling fey as a response to humanoid encroachment, huldras protect and parley for the forest itself. Woodland creatures adore huldras, and sometimes approach humans or elves thinking they're huldras. This illusion is shattered if the animal sees the humanoid's back is made of flesh or that they're lacking a tail, at which point the animal recoils and runs away.</p>\n<p>Huldras respond well to travelers who show respect and deference for the forest, bestowing those they favor with supernatural luck and fortune. Those who scorn or attack a huldra, or those who mock their distinctive, bovine tails, find themselves plagued by poor decisions and even worse luck. Huldras commonly carry a bad reputation as sirens of the deep forest-cunning monsters who seek to lure woodcutters and unwary adventurers to uncertain ends. These stories largely come from miscreants foolish enough to have treated a huldra rudely and later complain about how they were unjustly persecuted.

A Harrowing Vision takes an hour to perform, but most of that time consists of Hajeck and her chosen subject meditating and clearing their minds in a secluded area, culminating in an intense harrow reading that itself takes only a few minutes to complete. The target of a Harrowing Vision must remain adjacent to Hajeck for the entire hour, after which Hajeck shuffles her harrow deck and lays out seven cards, face down—one in the center (the future), two to either side (the present), and four more at the top, bottom, left, and right surrounding the central three (the past).</p>\n<p>When the harrowing takes place, the target flips over the four cards from the past, followed by the two present cards, and then finally the central card. This method of harrowing symbolizes how the choices a person made in their past often present them with an either/or decision in the now, and that their decision on that subject will lock in a future result. When All-Seeing Hajeck performs this reading for a PC, try to interpret the four cards from the past as representing events from that character's history—be it their background or references to events that took place during the Stolen Fate Adventure Path. For the two cards representing the present, try to interpret them as symbols of questions, events, or mysteries the PC is currently facing.</p>\n<p>Only the card representing the future has an actual game effect. When this central, final card is revealed, all of the PCs' potential futures suddenly flash in their mind in an overwhelming, chaotic vision. The PC must attempt a @Check[will|dc:32] save (note that as a PC grows more powerful and their Will save increases, they're more likely to achieve a better result from a Harrowing Vision, since they're that much closer to their ultimate destiny and are bolstered by the weight of their previous choices and decisions). If the suit of the card revealed for the PCs' future matches the PC's key ability from their class, they gain a +1 status bonus on this Will save. If the alignment of the card revealed matches the PC's alignment, they gain a +2 status bonus to this will save. If both match, these bonuses stack to a +3 status bonus, and the actual result of the save is improved by one degree of success. If neither the suit or alignment match the PC, they reduce the actual result of the save by one degree of success. Regardless of the result, that character cannot receive another Harrowing Vision until they gain a level, at which point any lingering effects from the Harrowing Vision end.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The character experiences a vision of a specific future success, only to forget it an instant later. Once only as long as this effect persists when the character is affected by a critical failure for any roll they make or a critical success with any roll a foe makes, the character can change that roll into a Success or a Failure, as they see fit. In addition, the character gains the</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> benefit detailed below.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The character experiences several overlapping potential successes in their future. As long as this effect persists (typically until the character gains a level), the maximum size of their hand for investing cards from the Deck of Destiny increases by 1 to six cards.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The vision is confusing and frightening, but has no lasting effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Not only is the vision confusing and frightening, but the character becomes obsessed with worst-case scenarios, becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed 1}, and becomes cursed—they can no longer gain the benefit of their best possible futures.

They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon-or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.</p>\n<p>Norns' relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire.</p>\n<p>While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns' interference. And so the balance of power remains tenuous between unaffiliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons. However, norns know that it's merely a matter of time before the Eldest lose their respect for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite norns' best efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions.</p>\n<p>A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.</p>\n<p>Worshipping Norns On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others, especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who uphold norns as deities are known as Followers of Fate. Norns do little to discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits regardless of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the aging process.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #192: Worst of All Possible Worlds"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"detect magic","mod":41,"senses":[{"type":"greater-darkvision"},{"acuity":"precise","range":120,"type":"lifesense"},{"acuity":"precise","range":60,"type":"truesight"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":34},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":30},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":38}},"skills":{"crafting":{"base":36},"deception":{"base":35},"intimidation":{"base":37},"medicine":{"base":38},"occultism":{"base":34},"performance":{"base":31},"religion":{"base":34}},"spellcasting":{"rituals":{"dc":42}},"traits":{"rarity":"unique","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["fey","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.stolen-fate-bestiary.Actor.P604YfY14wo4Uu56"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"pFs3lFkXrwNNUsDf","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"ThZaeJGfmFYyKI8D","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.e4NwsnPnpQKbDZ9F"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/weapons/composite-shortbow.webp","name":"Composite Shortbow","sort":100000,"system":{"baseItem":"composite-shortbow","bonus":{"value":0},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"bulk":{"value":1},"category":"martial","containerId":null,"damage":{"damageType":"piercing","dice":1,"die":"d6"},"description":{"value":"<p>This shortbow is made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together to increase the power of its pull and the force of its projectile.

Although folklore can be in error, little doubt exists that these flying apes make excellent warriors. History is also clear that derhiis fought countless battles for the Shory Empire, honing their tactical skills and martial traditions. Regardless of whether Shory magic was responsible for the birth of the first derhiis, lore passed down from those times shows the Shory Empire honored their soldiers and treated them as valued allies rather than mere servants.</p>\n<p>Derhiis are scarce even in the Mwangi Expanse, where the last of the Shory flying cities, such as Kho and Ulduvai, fell. Still, some dwell among the spires that tower above Shory ruins; these derhii are often quite a bit more powerful than the one detailed below. Other derhiis have spread from the remains of the fallen Shory empire to populate remote highlands and old-growth forests.</p>\n<p>Derhiis form small filial groups called troops, centered on one elder derhii and their relations. Several troops might gather into a larger society with a council of troop leaders under one dominant elder. Derhiis are omnivores who favor meat, unlike the terrestrial and largely herbivorous gorillas they resemble. It's possible that this habit developed due to a derhii need for substantial amounts of food coupled with their soldierly ways.</p>\n<h2>Derhii Artistry</h2>\n<p>Derhiis have little use for money, but they're talented crafters.

They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon-or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.</p>\n<p>Norns' relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire.</p>\n<p>While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns' interference. And so the balance of power remains tenuous between unaffiliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons.

Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits regardless of their choice.

They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon-or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.</p>\n<p>Norns' relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire.</p>\n<p>While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns' interference. And so the balance of power remains tenuous between unaffiliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons. However, norns know that it's merely a matter of time before the Eldest lose their respect for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite norns' best efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions.</p>\n<p>A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.</p>\n<p>Worshipping Norns On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others, especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who uphold norns as deities are known as Followers of Fate. Norns do little to discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits regardless of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the aging process.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #192: Worst of All Possible Worlds"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"detect magic","mod":41,"senses":[{"type":"greater-darkvision"},{"acuity":"precise","range":120,"type":"lifesense"},{"acuity":"precise","range":60,"type":"truesight"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":34},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":30},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":38}},"skills":{"crafting":{"base":36},"deception":{"base":35},"intimidation":{"base":37},"medicine":{"base":38},"occultism":{"base":34},"performance":{"base":31},"religion":{"base":34}},"spellcasting":{"rituals":{"dc":42}},"traits":{"rarity":"unique","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["fey","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.stolen-fate-bestiary.Actor.WddCUSjH70mHmzK3"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"WDHwcznFKZ0DlXoI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","items":[{"_id":"B2F4wEeParZMjcrT","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Damning Swarm","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":null,"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> a creature appears in area <strong>M1</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The swarming maggots squirm into a biting frenzy, and all creatures on the ground in area <strong>M1</strong> must attempt a @Check[fortitude|dc:40|traits:damaging-effect] save.
