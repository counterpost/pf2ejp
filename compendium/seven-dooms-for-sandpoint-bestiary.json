successful and most infamous: the drider. Fusing the body of a drow with that of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic fleshwarp-the only fleshwarp known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.</p>\n<p>Although the fleshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment for drow who fell from grace, the significant powers and strengths gained from the horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure. In return for mandatory time serving as a guardian, soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city's periphery. The painful truth is that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow have a penchant for working their fleshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.</p>\n<p>Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider's innate spells remain the same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different types of magic as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared than the drider presented below.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some creatures, notably drow, are not happy with merely killing their enemies. They revel in the total degradation of their foes through the horrifying transformative technique known as fleshwarping. Though the fleshwarping process was not created by the drow, many believe they perfected it. The drow torture their enemies in vats of churning magical reagents, reshaping their flesh and psyche alike into horrid and monstrous things. The reconstitution of flesh results in countless variations of fleshwarps, and the following are just a couple of examples of these horrors.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #200: Seven Dooms for Sandpoint"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":19,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":15},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":20},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":18}},"skills":{"arcana":{"base":20},"athletics":{"base":17},"deception":{"base":20},"intimidation":{"base":18},"occultism":{"base":18},"religion":{"base":17},"stealth":{"base":20}},"traits":{"rarity":"unique","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["aberration","chaotic"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.seven-dooms-for-sandpoint-bestiary.Actor.4p34LdwvJY2m3k7t"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"54wzV6OQLqhO7Tgl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"BMRz951juyBwJNqu","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Prepared Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"prepared"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":5,"prepared":[{"id":"2OUoykAaf4Kopr1r"},{"id":"v4vWf4Kungq7gjPo"},{"id":"nkALPoFivDBquqWT"},{"id":"6OAXjdCFFUKUN9ED"},{"id":"NIlqG7sdffDuN1KS"}]},"slot1":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"DR0HqHUTQuRyJJVk"},{"id":"UBpaBLzwRG9TY6C6"},{"id":"S0ffbtiJ3sCo8Jeq"}]},"slot2":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"zGcMHCRFumLEj8r4"},{"id":"iscWyltkJ9DELtrc"},{"id":"jXH4j96gZWc2wbz9"}]},"slot3":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"pJFZJurGpjTLmK6d"},{"id":"M6xIwgKsLWDeDfU3"},{"id":"xsmcESYTvlGyRzhz"}]},"slot4":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"OOU5rMQPH18YsxJD"},{"id":"feYtuB44ROvXXzMI"},{"id":"DGulCssjkoMjyI4j"}]},"slot5":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"y5LRGVbIwT6vKmN7"},{"id":"XLEjpHRea9TUJyOX"},{"id":"xHkKDOjqAcJqNuOS"}]},"slot6":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"qNSPxYnuDUYXdE4A"},{"id":"60vOT3qwL4VhE9He"},{"id":"PXG0ybGYpgWl3A0V"},{"id":null}]}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":34,"value":26},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"60QhhdNyLpF2h4bx","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":34,"value":26},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"60vOT3qwL4VhE9He","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.OsOhx3TGIZ7AhD0P"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/dominate.webp","name":"Dominate","sort":300000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"will"}},"description":{"value":"<p>You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders.

These succubi sought to slay a powerful witch who had befouled a profane temple the assassins served. The succubi failed at their mission, but from their corpses grew the first fungus tyrants. Pleased with this development, the witch then seeded numerous worlds on the Material Plane with fungus tyrant spores, who have since grown and thrived in their new environments as rot thrives in a corpse. Today, hundreds of fungus tyrants inhabit the fouler locales of the Material Plane. They're particularly fond of large cave systems and ruined cities, but also can be found in corrupted woodlands where blighted fey rule or in the sewers of active cities that spew vast amounts of magical waste.</p>\n<p>An encounter with a normally unintelligent plant monster acting with methodical intent can be evidence of a fungus tyrant's manipulations, but fungus tyrants are equally fond of keeping other types of creatures as pets and thralls—particularly attractive humanoids. Especially favored minions are given the gift of the fungus tyrant's embrace and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to their pallid ruler. Yet most fungus tyrants realize that a diverse array of guardians is best, and they often choose to keep some non-fungus minions on hand to protect their lair.</p>\n<p>Fungus tyrants are violently jealous. Any who attempt to lure away their dominated pets or cure those who have been infected by them earns their eternal ire. Yet it's succubi who enrage fungus tyrants the most. In these demons, the fungus tyrant sees a former glamour and power they no longer have access to, and only the brutal destruction of these mocking memories can salve a fungus tyrant's anger. A fungus tyrant faced with someone whom they suspect might be a succubus is terrible indeed, for in such battles, the fiendish fungal beings abandon their normal approach of subtle mental trickery and bring all of their power to bear in an attempt to rip the offending creature apart.

Pure midnight milk is incredibly rare—almost all of that found beyond the vault of Ilvarandin is instead cut to reduce costs and expenses. Crafting a dose of this dangerous drug requires a wide range of reagents; the most difficult to acquire of these reagents are vials of refined \"sweat\" harvested via a mithral blade from the fleshy fronds of a rare form of cavetongue fungus known as authul, which grows wild only in remote corners of the Vaults of Orv. When an alchemist mixes midnight milk, they must do so while in a trancelike state that approximates the dreaming mind—a classic method of reaching this state involves the repetition of a wordless chant spoken in a specific meter and rhyme scheme (one that the poet Vumeshki unknowingly duplicated with his dream-inspired poem, \"Ilvarandin\"). Recently, an experimental form of the drug created by the alchemist Aliver Podiker has been developed, but so far, attempts to replicate refined midnight milk using these methods have met with failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> @Check[fortitude|dc:29]</p>\n<p><strong>Onset</strong> 1 minute</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Duration</strong> 8 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> +3 item bonus to Perception (1 hour)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} (1 hour; if the creature recovers from the dosage and wakes up before reaching</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong>, they don't remember their vivid dreams but do wake up feeling revitalized as if they'd enjoyed a full 8 hours of sleep—this doesn't allow the creature to perform their daily preparations more often than once per day though)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> unconscious (1 hour; the vivid dreams the creature enjoys at</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> shift into phantasmagoric nightmares as described in the text above—during this stage, the creature is a viable <em>Dream Lens</em> target, and once a creature recovers and awakens from</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong>, they're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.HL2l2VRSaQHu9lUw]{Fatigued})</p>"},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn"},"hardness":0,"hp":{"max":0,"value":0},"level":{"value":12},"material":{"grade":null,"type":null},"price":{"value":{"gp":400}},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #200: Seven Dooms for Sandpoint"},"quantity":5,"rules":[],"size":"med","slug":"midnight-milk-refined","traits":{"rarity":"rare","value":["alchemical","consumable","drug","infused","ingested","poison"]},"usage":{"value":"held-in-one-hand"},"uses":{"autoDestroy":true,"max":1,"value":1},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"consumable","effects":[]},{"_id":"z0TZXVk5SR64H82Z","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.04giYigfDL5geu5f"},"img":"icons/consumables/potions/bottle-conical-corked-blue.webp","name":"Mistform Elixir (Greater)","sort":1300000,"system":{"baseItem":null,"bulk":{"value":0.1},"category":"elixir","containerId":null,"damage":null,"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">A</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A faint mist emanates from your skin, making you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} for 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>As usual being concealed when your position is still obvious, you can't use this concealment to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hide} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{Sneak}.</p>"},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn"},"hardness":0,"hp":{"max":0,"value":0},"level":{"value":10},"material":{"grade":null,"type":null},"price":{"value":{"gp":180}},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder GM Core"},"quantity":1,"rules":[],"size":"med","slug":"mistform-elixir-greater","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["alchemical","consumable","elixir","illusion","infused","visual"]},"usage":{"value":"held-in-one-hand"},"uses":{"autoDestroy":true,"max":1,"value":1},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"consumable","effects":[]},{"_id":"N5lyP6UGSHx9DQuL","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Wjkw0lEUOhypYvzo"},"img":"icons/consumables/potions/bottle-bulb-empty-glass.webp","name":"Shadow Essence","sort":1400000,"system":{"baseItem":null,"bulk":{"value":0.1},"category":"poison","containerId":null,"damage":null,"description":{"value":"<p>Distilled from the Plane of Shadow, this oily substance imposes tenebrous effects.

It wasn't long before the technique used to create sinspawn fell into the hands of the other runelords, and while each tried their own hand at crafting variants of their own design, today sinspawn of wrath remain the most numerous and notorious of their kind. Bearing only a vague resemblance to the humanoids from whose flesh they were formed, sinspawn generally appear horrifically emaciated and have unnaturally long arms and digitigrade legs, each with a trio of stubby, taloned digits. Veins bulge across sinspawn's bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their flesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated, bearing only slits for a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing pedipalps that end in tiny, three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue. Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human of their size. They behave in a manner consistent with their associated sin and have physical characteristics that hint at these qualities.
