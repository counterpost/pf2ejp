The desert drake is the prairie drake's closest known relative, as both share a strong affinity for earth, can burrow through soil, and hack up balls of dirt that they aim at enemies. But whereas a desert drake is sleek and nimble, flying through lightning storms and siroccos with ease, the prairie drake has all the grace of a chicken, barely able to flutter clumsily up a low hill or over a boulder. Owing to their largely vestigial wings, it's no wonder prairie drakes prefer burrowing over soaring.</p>\n<p>The average prairie drake has a temperament similar to that of a wicked child who delights in tormenting others. They ambush tiny animals from underground and play with their food thoroughly before eating. To assert their supremacy over other scrubland predators, prairie drakes knock down their rivals and attack them mercilessly. They often make grisly displays from the corpses of their foes to intimidate other would-be competitors.</p>\n<p>Prairie drakes build and live in burrow mounds just beneath the surface of their environs. They make shallow tunnels in search of large insects, rodents, and ground snakes. Prairie drakes' presence helps to turn the topsoil and encourage new plant growth, supporting other animal life and making them a keystone species for the environment. Even their breath weapon leaves behind rich \"drake soil,\" coveted by farmers and gardeners for the potent effects it has on plants. Being seen as \"useful\" or \"beneficial\" annoys most prairie drakes, who believe such a reputation makes them look weak and conflicts with their \"apex predator\" mystique. After they've gotten too much positive attention, a prairie drake is apt to murder a farm animal or destroy croplands only to prove that they're far from harmless.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #178: Punks in a Powder Keg"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":6,"senses":[{"acuity":"imprecise","range":30,"type":"tremorsense"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":6},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":6},"athletics":{"base":9},"intimidation":{"base":5},"survival":{"base":6}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"sm"},"value":["dragon","earth","evil"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.outlaws-of-alkenstar-bestiary.Actor.34HKPYSau0ugfMTv"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"3BFECcR5ggVH69Gu","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"Zn0AZHlLWAhHykEg","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":[]},"bonus":{"value":18},"damageRolls":{"fte6g98p0f65zet8q1l5":{"damage":"2d6+11","damageType":"slashing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["agile","reach-10"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"w7tFsYoTGHijK2vx","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Bite","sort":200000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["grab"]},"bonus":{"value":18},"damageRolls":{"wakfk2uerte34jiemt09":{"damage":"2d6+11","damageType":"piercing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["reach-15"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"oCmHqnzrHeampWv2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tail","sort":300000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"value":[]},"bonus":{"value":18},"damageRolls":{"0ohqbnhdhg7bypkyxfdk":{"damage":"2d6+11","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":"tail","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["agile","reach-10"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"HScepbVGbS75R0W3","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.TTCw5NusiSSkJU1x"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Void Healing","sort":400000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.NegativeHealing]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"system.attributes.hp.negativeHealing","value":true}],"slug":"negative-healing","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"Y1v59ZBvVAomH20U","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/TwoActions.webp","name":"Broad Swipe","sort":500000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":2},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p>The crocodile makes two Strikes with its tail against two adjacent foes, both of whom are within its reach.

Stories of ogre gluttons being tricked into eating razor-edged shields or barrels filled with poisoned meat are common, but such tales are of little consolation to those who have been gobbled down whole by these ravenous giants. In addition to their sadistic table manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming up with violent \"games\" that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those who somehow manage to beat a glutton at the rules of its own game can often enrage and frustrate the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum is more than enough distraction to afford a last-ditch escape from doom.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ogres embody brutish, amoral violence and cruelty. Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are as strong as they are cruel. Ogres are sadists that enjoy remorseless murder, torture, degradation, and mutilation in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on smaller humanoids-the smaller and more beautiful, the better-ogres promise a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp. But for all their creativity in developing methods of violence, ogres often remain too dim-witted to realize that their playthings lack an ogre's robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, so most captives die far sooner than the ogres might prefer. Such a fate is perhaps preferable however, as those who survive too long as ogres' playthings suffer lasting mental scars from the horrifying abuse. A captive able to keep their wits can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, meatier captives, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre's limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape.</p>\n<p>Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most powerful ogre in any family is the \"boss\"-usually the family's patriarch or matriarch-while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being brutalized by the boss's loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy.

Such is the grim tale of the first trapjaw tangles. These mechanical swarms were initially created as a solution to the pestilence of mutated rodents that plagued Alkenstar. These mobile rat traps, bound together by a magical matrix of occult energy, were programmed to wait in ambush or chase down their prey. The first trapjaw tangles proved effective and their creators were well rewarded for their ingenious designs. Soon trapjaw tangles were deployed throughout Alkenstar, Martel, and the Gunworks. Waves of them would be sent to roam into the Spellscar Desert, and the ever-present vermin were quickly forgotten.</p>\n<p>Then disaster struck. A rogue wave of magical energy washed over an airship that carried a trapjaw tangle in its hold.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #179: Cradle of Quartz"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":8},"occultism":{"base":4},"stealth":{"base":8}},"traits":{"rarity":"unique","size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["construct","lawful","soulbound"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.outlaws-of-alkenstar-bestiary.Actor.VfFt5YAVe7d9fonE"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"vnZFO1jNZSJieqpo","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"c58wczIzH2gzeXQL","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.c58wczIzH2gzeXQL"},"img":"icons/weapons/clubs/club-banded-brown.webp","name":"Club","sort":100000,"system":{"baseItem":"club","bonus":{"value":0},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"bulk":{"value":1},"category":"simple","containerId":null,"damage":{"damageType":"bludgeoning","dice":1,"die":"d6"},"description":{"value":"<p>This is a piece of stout wood shaped or repurposed to bludgeon an enemy.
