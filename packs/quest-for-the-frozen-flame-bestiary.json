Their eyes emit a soft glow at all times, but a blindheim can draw back the heavy membrane that normally covers them to emit an intense light as bright as day. These simple creatures use their lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents, or fish. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young. When they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, flashing their eyes to facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving deep and using its light to chase fish to the surface, while another up above snatches them up and tosses them onto the land to eat later.</p>\n<p>Blindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to underground lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of fungus to eat, a few fish swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water from the ceiling. Blindheims prefer to lead quiet and serene lives, and even when first born they emit only the meekest of vocalizations. A blindheim is born shining, and its parents cuddle over it to dim the light so as to avoid attracting predators.</p>\n<p>It's not just animals that endanger blindheims. Underground peoples find the creatures useful and attempt to capture them for specialized purposes. Duergars use them as \"raid frogs,\" placing heavy hoods over blindheims' heads and revealing them suddenly during raids to blind their foes. They sometimes send the creatures along with their slaves that lack darkvision into the mines as a source of light. Drow use them for some of these same purposes, and some nobles have been known to treat the creatures as mere lanterns, having them hoisted to the ceilings of their halls. Neither duergars nor drow take good care of the captive creatures, so blindheims rarely last long in captivity.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #175: Broken Tusk Moon"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":9,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":5}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":7},"athletics":{"base":6,"special":[{"base":7,"label":"to Jump or Swim"}]},"stealth":{"base":7}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"sm"},"value":["animal"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.quest-for-the-frozen-flame-bestiary.Actor.0GArHVfN0VxejVZp"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"0KrkQLsLX2PPUus7","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"fl5yawn8yoqeitko","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/conditions/slowed.webp","name":"Slowed","sort":100000,"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You have fewer actions.

Tapirs live in loose herds that graze near rivers and lakes. They enjoy fresh water, not only for the lush plants that grow along the shores-which they eat in prodigious quantities- but also for the protection the water provides. When predators approach, tapirs retreat to the water to hide, keeping their snouts barely above the surface to breathe. Likewise, the breezes and scents that accompany creeks and rivers mask tapirs' musk as they travel along these waterways. Despite their ungainly movement, tapirs are remarkably sure-footed, easily traversing mud and similar terrain thanks to their broad toes.</p>\n<p>Humanoids often hunt giant tapirs for their meat and durable hides. Such hunts are far from guaranteed, though; tapirs can run at least as fast as their hunters, and most will fight if cornered. The docile giants do what they can to avoid confrontation whenever possible. If they sense danger approaching, giant tapirs make a loud whistling sound to warn other tapirs about predators. A community who befriends or domesticates a herd of tapirs can use this whistling habit as an alarm system against encroaching enemies.</p>\n<p>Giant tapirs are usually quite placid, but they can be fearsome when roused. Their tusk-like front teeth are suitable for gouging attackers, and a tapir that manages to get a mouthful of an enemy's arm or leg can use its blunt molars to grind the flesh to paste. Tapirs have good hearing and an excellent sense of smell, but like many prey animals, they have poor vision. In the chaos of combat against multiple enemies, giant tapirs can become overwhelmed and confused, lashing out at allies as well as foes or fleeing the scene entirely.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #175: Broken Tusk Moon"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"type":"low-light-vision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":30,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":11},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":8,"special":[{"base":10,"label":"to Swim","predicate":["action:swim"]}]},"stealth":{"base":5}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["animal"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.quest-for-the-frozen-flame-bestiary.Actor.iEOeCyL10neiaShj"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"IP3fGAEz3Nw1TzDD","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"nihyd90cq9gb72un","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Antlers","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":[]},"bonus":{"value":9},"damageRolls":{"IYNNIIeB5ZyxBA16":{"damage":"1d6+4","damageType":"piercing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"s9pfmxb0v3eef7d9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Hoof","sort":200000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":[]},"bonus":{"value":9},"damageRolls":{"ncChNqULIfKWdPRD":{"damage":"1d4+4","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"JHwgG3noeNKXQBoV","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.nZMQh4AaBr291TUf"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","name":"Buck","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>@Check[reflex|dc:17]</p>\n<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Buck]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"},"rules":[],"slug":"buck","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"r9il72vdegwn8cj5","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/TwoActions.webp","name":"Startled Charge","sort":400000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":2},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Requirements</strong> It's the first round of combat</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The elk Strides twice and makes a hoof Strike at the end of either Stride.

Groplits are best known for their greasy skin and queasy hygienic habits: they spend most of each day using their two long tongues to slurp up their own oily excretions or similarly viscous discharge originating from plants or other animals. Although they prefer to dwell in northern wetlands, fens, and moist caves, groplits can thrive in all but the most barren environments. They'll eat just about anything, though they tend to prefer small, crunchy animals like bugs and birds.</p>\n<p>Groplits are famously loyal and highly sociable companions, and they make for dedicated, if somewhat odd-looking, pets. They can be taught simple commands and appear to take great pride in obeying them, performing stunts even in the face of obvious danger. An unscrupulous master might train a groplit with the intent to sacrifice it in an emergency, a fate to which the groplit is happily resigned. This single-minded obedience and their slow reproductive rate make groplits fairly rare in the wild.</p>\n<p>As a result of the way their bones are structured, groplits exhibit an imperturbable smile, of sorts-a physical feature which some find as creepy (or enraging) as others find it endearing. Its apparently ceaseless jubilation has given this creature the nickname \"the grinning toad\" in some parts of the world.</p>\n<p>Because they love to lap up oily matter of all kinds, groplits are naturally drawn to greasy animals like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-monster-core.Actor.tashopA1s2fAbSXA]{Slurks}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-2.Actor.g1htYgARxNKxc7MV]{Giant Slugs}, and lagofirs.

Tapirs live in loose herds that graze near rivers and lakes. They enjoy fresh water, not only for the lush plants that grow along the shores-which they eat in prodigious quantities- but also for the protection the water provides. When predators approach, tapirs retreat to the water to hide, keeping their snouts barely above the surface to breathe. Likewise, the breezes and scents that accompany creeks and rivers mask tapirs' musk as they travel along these waterways. Despite their ungainly movement, tapirs are remarkably sure-footed, easily traversing mud and similar terrain thanks to their broad toes.</p>\n<p>Humanoids often hunt giant tapirs for their meat and durable hides. Such hunts are far from guaranteed, though; tapirs can run at least as fast as their hunters, and most will fight if cornered. The docile giants do what they can to avoid confrontation whenever possible. If they sense danger approaching, giant tapirs make a loud whistling sound to warn other tapirs about predators. A community who befriends or domesticates a herd of tapirs can use this whistling habit as an alarm system against encroaching enemies.</p>\n<p>Giant tapirs are usually quite placid, but they can be fearsome when roused.

These itinerant folk have an innate curiosity about the woodlands in which they dwell, and rarely stop to take root and rest in the same part of the forest twice. This wanderlust makes wardens ideal forest patrollers and scouts. While they are robust combatants, they know better than to confront dangerous foes on their own. Instead, they report any dangers to arboreal regents. In rare cases, large groups of arboreal wardens congregate to form a copse. Copses travel beyond the boundaries of a forest to investigate the hinterlands and gather intelligence on potential threats before returning to report their findings.

Though they rarely seek out the companionship of short-lived folk-even elves are fugacious in the eyes of arboreals-and have an inherent distrust of change, arboreals have been known to tolerate those who seek to learn from their long-winded, rambling monologues, especially if such pupils also express a desire to protect the timberlands.
