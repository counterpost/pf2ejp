Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-rank spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's initial lesson. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to. Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Spells:</strong> Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a written version of that spell over the course of 1 hour. This can be a scroll of that spell, or you can prepare a written version using the Learn a Spell exploration activity. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.</p>\n<p><strong>Undying:</strong> If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless.

Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h2>Spellbook</h2>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via Learn a Spell. When you gain spell slots of a new rank, you also add an additional spell from your school's curriculum (unless it's the school of unified magical theory).</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"hCPg4kLKbrpvo8QF","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"rules":[{"flag":"castASpell","key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz"}],"slug":"wizard-spellcasting","traits":{"rarity":"common","selected":{},"value":["wizard"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","effects":[]},{"_id":"m556IXbGTN1pcMhf","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.M89l9FOnjHe63wD7"},"flags":{"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"experimentalSpellshaping":{"id":"0CKHJMZee6FX839k","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"img":"icons/sundries/scrolls/scroll-writing-tan-grey.webp","name":"Arcane Thesis","sort":100,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research.

Hatched under an auspicious sign, Kaako's parents pronounced her a jinx-eater, one who might consume the ill fortune falling over the crew and bring them good luck. Unsurprisingly, the crew took an instant liking to her mischievous antics. Growing up aboard a ship, Kaako spent her formative years meeting all sorts of folks from the wider world, sailing up and down the coasts of Avistan and Garund. They were good years and ones that she looks back upon with fond nostalgia.</p>\n<p>Years later, Kaako left her parents to join the crew of Captain Renlock aboard the Brass Bird. For some time, she remained happy there. The crew of the Brass Bird made names for themselves as pirates aboard one of the most feared vessels to sail the coasts. When the Bird overtook a small merchant vessel off the coast of Varisia, Kaako encountered a jinx that even she could not prevent. Having no desire to take the ship or hostages, the Bird's crew raided the vessel for valuables before setting it free. One passenger-a Varisian witch-took umbrage to the theft and bestowed a curse upon the Bird and its crew. After that fateful day, the ship was continually beset by storms and bad winds. The Brass Bird constantly ran afoul of patrols of various navies ready to apprehend the ship. All this led to the fateful encounter with the Andoran navy. Chased back to the Shackles, the Brass Bird and its crew were finally overcome. Wanting no more bloodshed, Captain Renlock surrendered and the crew of the Brass Bird scattered.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Kaako was released only a few months later and returned to a life on the open ocean. Though she joined crews aboard other ships, Kaako never truly found a home again. Five years later, Kaako still enjoys the life of a pirate, but grows weary of lining other peoples' pockets with gold while leaving little for herself. Then word came that Captain Renlock had passed away in prison. And his mysterious clockwork parrot, Cawlo, arrived at the window of Kaako's cabin to deliver a messageâ€¦</p>\n<p><strong>Goals</strong> Kaako dreams of a future in which she might captain her own ship or at least find a crew that she can call a family. Life on the high seas can be tiring, especially when there is little to show for it after years of work.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality</strong> Kaako is inquisitive, but quick to startle. She has a penchant for dressing flamboyantly, adorning herself with shiny trinkets and baubles that she claims help her ward off foul spirits and curses. In reality, she just likes the way these accessories look. Kaako is not above playing up her \"mystical\" connection, despite not really having much control over such matters. Among friends though, she is much more laid back and can be a prankster.</p>\n<p><strong>Relationships</strong> Most see Kaako as a strange and mysterious person who has many secrets. As a result, few try to become close to her. Those who do get to know the young tengu find that she can be a caring friend, even though she tends to be a bit awkward around other humanoids.</p>","attitude":"","backstory":"","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"<p><em>Elsir Syniras:</em> Kaako and Elsir used to be close friends and often went into port to get into trouble together.

The two often spent long nights on the deck looking out at the stars, sharing a bottle, and dreaming of a rich and prosperous future.</p>\n<p><em>Jadren Tagar:</em> Jadren has always been a pain in Kaako's backside. The life of the party, daring first officer, and charming pirate was just more than Kaako could handle.

For years, the Hookclaws despaired over finding him a job within the tribe, despite his incredible strength. The militia commanders threw Simeek out after he constantly failed the most basic of instructions. Simeek's stint as a trap re-setter ended when he was too nervy to learn to work a crossbow without causing accidents. Eventually the hapless kobold wound up as a simple laborer, tasked with nothing more complex than moving heavy crates from one place to another. And yet, this simple decision would wind up drastically changing the course of the Hookclaw tribe's history. When a bloodthirsty adventurer proved too skilled for the kobolds' traps and broke into the warren, Simeek happened to be working in the area. For once, the kobold reacted boldly in his panic and hit the adventurer with a barrel until the intruder ran away.</p>\n<p>Now Simeek is a hero to the tribe-at least, the other kobolds reason, until something inevitably eats him. The Hookclaws discovered they liked having a hero, though, and have invested a lot of work to make Simeek live up to the title. Simeek has been delighted by unexpected gifts of clothing and armor, which allow him to look like the shining knights he admired as a hatchling (having crucially misunderstood the point of knight and dragon tales, especially among kobolds). Of course, Simeek is still completely hopeless, and so the Hookclaws have made sure that several other kobolds remain with him at all times to ensure he doesn't freeze and get himself killed.</p>\n<p>Simeek himself is simply happy that the other kobolds like him now, and cheerfully goes along with whatever he's told. He has survived his change in profession mostly through luck, but on occasion, when he panics in the right direction, he lives up to his title of hero again. He has proven too oblivious to trick and too innocent to corrupt, which drives the Hookclaws to despair, but has also sparked a certain amount of possessive pride. After all, Simeek has a heart of metaphorical gold... which is the closest thing to real gold most Hookclaws have ever encountered.</p>","attitude":"","backstory":"","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"class":{"value":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/assets/sheet/deity.webp","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["common","draconic"]},"level":{"min":1,"value":1},"nationality":{"value":"Hookclaws"},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"rank":2,"value":0},"reflex":{"rank":2,"value":0},"will":{"rank":1,"value":0}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.paizo-pregens.Actor.Ffnp6AbRVhjmLH9T"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"GKuqaB0W8hbH3H90","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/halfling.svg","items":[{"_id":"TvQ7MS5tp1dDSXl4","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Mercantile Lore","sort":1200000,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"CDXMbAM2rv0kUafe","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Sailing Lore","sort":1300000,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":2},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ZqGDgYFDL5wTJD46","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Gmk7oNITvMVBy78Z"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/heritage.svg","name":"Undine","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":null,"description":{"value":"<p>A water elemental ancestor influences your bloodline.

Sold by her Chelaxian masters to a merchant captain at a very young age, Lavanna soon found freedom on the open waters, rising up through the ranks of the Silver Dancer, the first ship she ever served as a crew member. One evening, during a particularly fearsome storm, Lavanna was caught on deck, but instead of being tossed about or swept overboard, the young halfling found peace in the swirling winds and felt grace in the stinging waves washing over her. This was the first time she heard the voice of Gozreh and discovered that she had undine blood in her veins.</p>\n<p>Lavanna's training was anything but traditional. She learned what she could about the faith of Gozreh at every port of call, all the while maintaining her duties aboard the merchant vessel. Over time, she became quite accomplished and took over as the Silver Dancer's healer. A year later, her skills were put to the test when a horrific fire broke out onboard and the vessel began to sink. It was only through Lavanna's skill that any of the crew survived that catastrophe. Fortunately, their ship was spotted by the Brass Bird, a pirate ship of some renown. Captain Renlock took pity on the poor souls of the Silver Dancer, taking them on and dropping them off at the nearest port.</p>\n<p>Lavanna decided to stay onboard the Brass Bird, helping to minister to the crew and ensure that the ship sailed with Gozreh's grace. Although never having much stomach for piracy, Lavanna took to life aboard the Bird, finding she had much in common with the motley crew. Outcasts and wanderers all, they forged lives for themselves of their own choosing. For a time, that was enough. Trouble came to the Brass Bird when its crew boarded a small merchant vessel off the coast of Varisia. After taking the ship's valuables, Captain Renlock let the crew go. However, a Varisian witch took umbrage to the theft and laid a curse on the Bird and its crew. Terrible storms beset the Bird and its crew. No amount of prayers to Gozreh could cause the seas to calm. Worse still, the Andoran navy caught wind of the Bird's trail and pursued the ship at every turn.</p>\n<p>After a pitched battle, Captain Renlock surrendered the ship and the small family that Lavanna had come to cherish was torn asunder. Fortunately, the halfling soon found her freedom again after only a few months in jail. Heading down to the port, she ran into her old captain who she helped rescue all those years ago. Not two days later she set sail again, this time on the Silver Dancer II. The past five years have been mostly peaceful and prosperous. Lavanna has become comfortable and with that comfort has come doubt. While ministering to the crew is important work, she sometimes wonders if the comfort and routine she enjoys aboard the ship aligns with the tenets of her deity.</p>\n<p>Such thoughts will have to wait, however, as word has reached her that Captain Renlock has passed away in prison. Oddly, the news was delivered by his curious clockwork parrot, Cawloâ€¦</p>\n<p><strong>Goals</strong> Lavanna finds herself at a crossroads and must decide whether or not to abandon her easy lifestyle. Her wanderlust grows by the day and soon it might overwhelm her. She wants to get back out into open water desperately so that she can sail new seas, meet new people, and see all that Gozreh's bounty has provided.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality</strong> Lavanna is in a bit of a rut. She craves the open ocean, to dare the sea and storms, sailing off into the unknown to see all of nature's bounty. Unfortunately, years of work on a merchant vessel have made her soft and complacent. The crew of the Silver Dancer II tends to play it safe, sticking to the shore during dangerous weather and traveling using proscribed routes. Though Lavanna considers ministering to the crew important, she often finds herself bored with the lack of danger in her routine.</p>\n<p>Lavanna also remains fascinated by nature, but in particular with the ocean and the creatures that call it home. She can be quiet at times, but when it comes to talking about the sea, most find that they can't get in a word between her frantic rants.</p>\n<p><strong>Relationships</strong> Lavanna used to have a bit of a wild streak, getting deep into the grog and singing sea shanties with the rest of the crew. These days she has settled down to the point that the crew of the Silver Dancer II see her as a bit of a bore.</p>","attitude":"","backstory":"","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"<p><em>Elsir Syniras</em>: Elsir was never really one to be trusted. Although he never swindled folks onboard, Lavanna saw the elven sorcerer use his magic on multiple occasions to con or steal from folks at port. Worse still, his dour attitude and aversion to risk made him less than fun to be around.</p>\n<p><em>Jadren Tagar</em>: Lavanna and Jadren used to be almost inseparable. The hulking human fighter was fun, often telling wild stories from his youth. There was a time when Lavanna thought there might be more to it than that, but such feelings never went anywhere.</p>\n<p><em>Kaako Ashfeather</em>: Lavanna and the tengu rogue got along just fine, even though she never really believed in Kaako's jinx-eating abilities. That said, she did enjoy going to new places and seeing new things, which made her a fine companion aboard the Brass Bird.</p>","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"class":{"value":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/deity/Gozreh.webp","value":"Gozreh"},"ethnicity":{"value":"Chelaxian"},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"heritage":{"value":"Undine"},"keyability":{"value":"wis"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["common","halfling","thalassic"]},"level":{"min":1,"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"rank":2,"value":0},"reflex":{"rank":1,"value":0},"will":{"rank":2,"value":0}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":2},"nature":{"rank":1},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":2},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.paizo-pregens.Actor.GKuqaB0W8hbH3H90"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Ip0EDqMZqgXmcBgZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/kobold.svg","items":[{"_id":"z6JxNqL5doMdHWCi","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Farming Lore","sort":100000,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"LC2avmpLy44MzeyX","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.backgrounds.Item.SOmJyAtPOokesZoe"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/background.svg","name":"Farmhand","sort":0,"system":{"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"wis","value":["con","wis"]},"1":{"selected":"cha","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]}},"description":{"value":"<p>With a strong back and an understanding of seasonal cycles, you tilled the land and tended crops.

You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest rank of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1* </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1* </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"w3awaf1Zan1ex93J","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"rules":[],"slug":"sorcerer-spellcasting","traits":{"rarity":"common","selected":{"sorcerer":"Sorcerer"},"value":["sorcerer"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","effects":[]},{"_id":"zXZ0VMZf76MHENxb","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.2goYo6VNbwC6aKF1"},"flags":{"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"bloodlineGenie":{"id":"6hGWcLgvyZyZZvKr","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"img":"icons/magic/symbols/question-stone-yellow.webp","name":"Bloodline","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent.

Growing up in Osirion, the young elf spent his formative years living on the streets, scavenging for food where he could find it. Had it not been for a fierce pack of jackals that cornered him in an alley late one night, the frail elf might have never discovered his true potential. In that moment, as the snarling beasts approached to make their kill, the magic in his blood surged to life and he nearly drowned them in a seemingly unending torrent of water.</p>\n<p>Soon after, Elsir often used his newfound gifts to earn coin. At first, he performed tricks on the street corner, but he moved into taverns soon after. As his talent with magic grew, so did his skill with deception and guile. After all, who in their right mind would settle for a few coins as a tip when one could pilfer a whole purse from a patron distracted by a magical spell? Unsurprisingly, he found himself wanted by the law soon after and fled Osirion just six months later. Elsir's pattern-of arriving in a new town, performing at local taverns or on street corners, and eventually being run out of the city for his schemes-continued for several years.</p>\n<p>It wasn't until Elsir joined a pirate crew that he found a home. To this day, Elsir can't imagine what Captain Renlock saw in him, but he is eternally grateful for the years spent aboard the Brass Bird. Whenever the Bird's crew put into port, he worked his trade, earned some extra coin, and disappeared before anyone even suspected him. Meanwhile, aboard the ship, his talent for water magic made him invaluable to the crew. And his eye for valuables and magic items was found desirable by the captain whenever the crew acquired new treasure.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this too came to an end. After the Brass Bird boarded a Varisian merchant vessel, the witch onboard cursed Captain Renlock's ship. From that day forward, the crew's luck turned. Elsir was there when it happened, and he can't help but feel that the curse was aimed at him specifically. The seas turned against the Brass Bird and soon after the Andoran navy pursued the ship relentlessly. After a pitched battle, Captain Renlock surrendered and Elsir finally saw the inside of a prison cell. Released only a few months later, Elsir made his way back to Absalom, leaving behind the sea for good (or so he thought).</p>\n<p>There in the massive metropolis, Elsir set up shop as a purveyor of magic trinkets and spells, using his talents to create fakes or pass off minor baubles as powerful relics. Whenever the locals suspected him of foul play, he simply packed up and moved to a new district. With a city as large as Absalom, he had plenty of places to go to, avoiding suspicion for over five years. But the old witch's curse was not done with him yet, and after a customer came in with an actual cursed ring, Elsir has found himself bound to the foul thing. Thanks to the ring's curse, his body has been slowly wasting away over time.</p>\n<p>Worse, he just received word that Captain Renlock passed away in prison. The old captain and his strange clockwork bird were always kind to Elsir, and the loss has hit him hardâ€¦</p>\n<p><strong>Goals</strong> First and foremost, Elsir wants to find the coin necessary for a powerful casting of remove curse, to free himself of the ring that drains his vitality. Although he would never admit it, Elsir is tired of his current life. The thrill of deceiving the rich is long gone and he would much rather find a way to earn a modest living using his magic honestly. However, he struggles to imagine a world in which anyone would actually accept him in that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality</strong> Elsir often comes off as bitter and jaded. He has spent a lifetime relying on cons and using his magic to earn a living. Although he normally targets merchants and nobles who can afford to lose a few coins, no one can deny that Elsir is a cheat. He is cynical about the world and his pessimism often gets the better of him. As the years have worn on, this has only gotten worse. Nothing is ever easy for Elsir-at least from his perspective.</p>\n<p><strong>Relationships</strong> Elsir has always been a bit of a cynic, but whereas his sarcasm used to permeate through the occasional comment or observation, it now tends to color everything he does.</p>","attitude":"","backstory":"","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"<p><em>Jadren Tagar:</em> Jadren was usually too much for Elsir. The loud, boisterous first mate was always the center of attention, which suited Elsir just fine-it meant fewer people bothered the sorcerer. Worse still, Jadren never seemed able to remember Elsir's name.</p>\n<p><em>Kaako Ashfeather:</em> Kaako and Elsir were often bound up in some scheme or another in just about every port of call. Kaako often created a distraction in busy places, allowing Elsir to work the crowd and swindle passersby to make some quick coin. The two often spent long nights up on deck, gazing at the stars, sharing a bottle, and dreaming of a rich and prosperous future.</p>\n<p><em>Lavanna Saltspray:</em> Elsir and Lavanna never really got along. He got the impression that she didn't appreciate his antics in port, which he saw as a hypocritical coming from the priest of a pirate vessel. Worse still, Elsir has little use for faith, a belief that has only grown over the years.</p>","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"class":{"value":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/assets/sheet/deity.webp","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":"Auideen"},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"heritage":{"value":"Desert"},"keyability":{"value":"cha"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["common","elven","goblin","thalassic"]},"level":{"min":1,"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"rank":2,"value":0},"reflex":{"rank":1,"value":0},"will":{"rank":2,"value":0}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":1},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":2},"deception":{"rank":2},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":1},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":1},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.paizo-pregens.Actor.MzfFXoNb28HBjajw"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"NedNTpCBQhSzDAwg","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/kobold.svg","items":[{"_id":"18eRpNneLabrhh4J","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Bardic Lore","sort":1800000,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Pwvc6tvyHdyAWaWl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Kobold Lore","sort":1900000,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"nFH7qeOO83cAd7cF","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Warfare Lore","sort":2000000,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"xX3Eb8v3GfwxFruO","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.P8BP1un5BTrwXoBy"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/dragonscaled-kobold.webp","name":"Dragonscaled Kobold","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Kobold","slug":"kobold","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.7oQxL6wgsokD3QXG"},"description":{"value":"<p>Your scales are especially colorful, possessing some of the same resistance a dragon possesses.

One day when excavating the buried remains of a house, Rhin managed to retrieve a mostly intact children's book. Intrigued by the colorful pictures, Rhin carefully peeled the pages apart to investigate his new find. Though the book was written in a language he didn't understand and the writing was mostly ruined, the illustrations painted a clear story: Rhin was entranced by the tale of a human boy with a magic ring who went on daring adventures and could call a dragon from the sea with a special tune. </span></p>\n<p>Convinced this was some manner of history book, Rhin has done everything to emulate this mysterious hero. </span></p>\n<p>He scrimped coins and collected cloth scraps to stitch together an outfit to match the boy in the tale. A copper ring, tarnished to green, graces one of his fingers. Somewhat more practically, Rhin put himself through a crash course in martial arts, emulating the poses and maneuvers the boy performed-while this was hardly the best of teachers, it also proved to be far from the worst of them. The most surprising thing to the other Hookclaw kobolds, however, was Rhin's music. Whenever Rhin plays a certain set of tunes, magic seems to answer. </span></p>\n<p>Rhin firmly believes that his power comes from a sleeping dragon in Absalom's harbor that listens to his ocarina in its dreams and sends its power in return.

At least, that's what Grimmnir claims. Other Hookclaws have noticed that her magic doesn't seem much like that of other kobold dragon mages. To put it simply, Grimmnir is... creepy. Where dragons pulse with arcane power and unfettered charisma, Grimmnir's sorcery has always felt foreboding and hateful, laced with a shivering chill of damnation that crawls up the spine and chews on the back of the mind. Grimmnir always gets very scary and glows her eyes whenever anyone brings it up, though, so the Hookclaws keep their mouths shut and don't argue with her. </span></p>\n<p>Grimmnir pays them little mind. She knows she is a true child of dragons. Ever since she was a hatchling, Grimmnir has dreamed of them: world-ending wyrms that lurk in the deepest recesses of reality, beneath the waves and beyond the universe, who gnaw on the roots of existence and will rise up from the depths at the end of days. Yet though that destructive power is her legacy, Grimmnir has decided not to follow in those great wyrms' footsteps-not completely. The kobold has performed a careful consideration of all the pros and cons, and decided that destroying the world would be both personally inconvenient and more trouble than it's worth. </span></p>\n<p>All the same, Grimmnir feels compelled to embrace her destiny to become one of the devourers of worlds, even if she never actually does any world-devouring. In her mind, this means growing much, much taller, and building her strength through any means possible. Despite cramming herself full of food and other brilliant ideas, the kobold has had no luck increasing her height, so she has been forced to turn all her efforts to self-improvement. To this end, Grimmnir has joined the kobold militia, intending to turn her acid-tipped claws and fearsome bite against whatever obstacles she encounters. The Hookclaws appreciate her prowess at protecting the tribe-and appreciate it even more when Grimmnir is out on patrol and thus nowhere to be seen!</span></p>","attitude":"","backstory":"","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"class":{"value":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/assets/sheet/deity.webp","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"cha"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["common","draconic"]},"level":{"min":1,"value":1},"nationality":{"value":"Hookclaws"},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"rank":1,"value":0},"reflex":{"rank":1,"value":0},"will":{"rank":2,"value":0}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":1},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":1},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":1},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.paizo-pregens.Actor.oIfXnKl0KzboCYBH"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"pdZNO5gqhB4hN61A","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/kitsune.svg","items":[{"_id":"tE9jrjPpJKtHaksH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Hunting Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":2},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"hZulV30oPDpivEcR","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Warfare Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"BxICWbkH2Nl6qPEi","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.backgrounds.Item.r0kYIbN06Cv8eNG3"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/background.svg","name":"Warrior","sort":0,"system":{"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"str","value":["con","str"]},"1":{"selected":"con","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]}},"description":{"value":"<p>In your younger days, you waded into battle as a mercenary, a warrior defending a nomadic people, or a member of a militia or army.

and emissaries of the environment, leshies are immortal spirits of nature temporarily granted a physical form.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Leshies are 'born' when a skilled druid or other master of primal magic conducts a ritual to create a suitable vessel, and then a spirit chooses that vessel to be their temporary home. Leshies are self-sufficient from the moment the ritual ends, and so they do not depend upon these druids for care, though</p>\n<p>Not all leshies have a strong enough spirit to strike off completely on their own, however. Weaker nature spirits can form only tenuous bonds that are just strong enough to animate Tiny bodies. These spirits become leshy familiars, acting as companions to their druid creators. Independent leshies are often protective of such leshy familiars, advocating for them to be treated with dignity and respect.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Act as a traveling agent for natural guardians who are unable to leave their territories.</li>\n<li>Encourage civilizations you encounter to cooperate with nature and build their cities in ecologically friendly ways.</li>\n<li>Become attached to new friends you make on your journeys.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think of you as a curiosity due to your spiritual origins.</li>\n<li>Judge you by your looks, treating you sweetly if you are cute or reacting with horror if you are frightening.</li>\n<li>Assume you know only about nature and are unfamiliar with civilization and society.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Leshies are as varied as the material used to create their vessels, usually appearing as a bizarre mishmash of various plants or fungi. Their bodies are vaguely humanoid in shape, with numerous characteristics of the plant or fungus from which they were made. A typical leshy is about 3 feet tall. Due to the nature of the ritual used to create a leshy, leshies begin their lives as adults. As spirits, they do not age, and a leshy could potentially remain in the same vessel foreverâ€”though leshies rarely consider this outcome to be desirable.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Though guardian leshies often congregate, traveling leshies are not naturally drawn to others of their own kind. To most leshies, the concept of family is not a matter of birth, but rather determined by bonds of loyalty and friendship. Leshies are dedicated allies, but they have little tolerance for those who would despoil nature. As much as they are happy to accept someone who earns their trust into their family, they expect family members to look out for them and their natural wards in return. A betrayed leshy might not directly attack those who slight them, but they might withdraw support at a critical moment or leave their betrayers to get lost in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>Leshies are grouped into categories akin to ethnicities, but these are not connected to physical features; rather, they represent broad categories of characteristics of their spirits. Certain spirits are more likely to gravitate toward particular physical bodies, though those familiar with leshies know that this predisposition is far from absolute. Leshies often take pride in their own appearances and appreciate beauty of all kinds in others, but they rarely form judgments based on physical appearance. Leshies' genders are determined by the spirits that inhabit their bodies. Leshies tend to gravitate toward plant bodies that match their genders. Some leshies are exclusively male or female, while many consider themselves both. Others, particularly fungus leshies, tend toward far more complex expressions of gender, or eschew the concept entirely.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>A leshy can be of any alignment, depending on what spirit inhabits their body, but their outlook often includes a neutral element. Religion is not particularly significant to most leshies. Those with a philosophical bent lean toward the Green Faith, and Gozreh is the most popular deity among faithful leshies. Some leshies also venerate green men, powerful spirits of nature that act as regional guardians.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Some backgrounds are particularly suitable for adventuring leshies, especially those backgrounds with a tie to the natural world, such as hunter, nomad, or scout. Nature-themed classes such as druid and ranger are popular choices for leshies. As druids, leshies gravitate toward the leaf order. Bard is also a good fit for leshies with a love of storytelling; such leshies often inhabit vine leshy bodies.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Leshies choose and change their names multiple times throughout their lives. These names often represent a facet of their personalities or values, though another common naming convention is to use descriptions of a natural feature they admire. Some leshies even use a cycle of names that changes to align with natural phenomena, such as names based upon the season or the time of day.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Scarlet in Summer, Verdant Taleweaver, Lurking Hunter, Masterful Sun Drinker, Noon Sky Evening Song, Snowy Pine Branch, Cascading Rapids</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Leshy Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Sylvan</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

The first act began during his younger years, growing up on the streets in the Narrows district of Oppara. He led a gang of children that soon turned into a guild of pickpockets and minor thieves. Years later, a sweep by law enforcement rounded up half of his gang and Jadren remained sure his guildmates would finger him as the ringleader. He fled the city that evening, leaving behind the only place he had ever called home. For months he wandered from port to port, drinking and carousing until he woke one morning after having signed on with the pirate crew of the Brass Bird.</p>\n<p>At first, he had demonstrated no skill at sailing, but as the years passed, he learned just about every role aboard a ship, from cook to bosun. Jadren often found himself the life of every party, telling outlandish and ridiculous stories from his youth. As a result, Captain Renlock took a liking to him. Several good years passed and the captain promoted Jadren to first mate. Just after the promotion, everything went wrong.</p>\n<p>After chasing down a Varisian merchant vessel, the crew boarded the ship to search for loot. Taking what cargo they could find, the captain agreed to let the crew and ship go, but a Varisian witch onboard took umbrage to the theft and cursed the Brass Bird and her crew. Not two days later, the ship was beset by storms and bad wind. A week after that, the Andoran navy finally tracked the Bird down. For days, Jadren's crew sailed south, trying to get back to the Shackles. However, the Andoran navy did not relent in their pursuit. Captain Renlock desperately tried to return the Brass Bird to his secret port on a small island just to the north of the pirate nation, but the winds were against him.</p>\n<p>After a pitched battle in which Jadren was severely injured, Captain Renlock surrendered. And just like that, the first act of Jadren's life ended. Waking up in temple to Iomedae in Andoran was the first thing he remembered after the battle. The priest here tended to Jadren's wounds and helped set his bones. It was a long recovery, one that the priests wanted him to make on his own-without the aid of magic-so that he could see the full cost of the life he had chosen. After weeks of healing, the priests gave him a choice. He could go to prison for several months to serve his sentence, or he could stay on with them and help tend to the temple and serve the poor as penance.</p>\n<p>Since that sounded better than a prison cell, Jadren agreed. Over the next few months, Jadren learned a lot about himself and carefully considered his past. He had lived a life of greed, thinking only of himself and his own pleasure. Through helping others, the priests showed him the value of a life of service and humility. They also taught him discipline and trained him in martial skills. These priests' teachings also persuaded Jadren that giving one's life over to the greater good could provide a stronger sense of purpose.</p>\n<p>When the time came for him to leave, Jadren asked to stay and began training to become a champion of the faith. Now, several years later, Jadren has molded himself into a changed man. He is a staunch warrior dedicated to Iomedae, willing to lay down his life in service to others. He is especially keen to help those who have chosen a life of crime to see the error in their ways as he has. Unfortunately, he has learned it is too late for his previous friend and mentor, Captain Renlock. The captain's famous clockwork parrot, Cawlo, arrived at the temple just yesterday to tell Jadren of his passing. And Cawlo arrived bearing a cryptic request...</p>\n<p><strong>Goals</strong> Jadren seeks to atone for the harm he caused during his previous life. He would like nothing better than to change his past, despite that fact that this is likely impossible. Though he knows he might never redeem himself, he focuses on taking action that he believes can make the world better.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Jadren is warm and friendly, almost to a fault. While his demeanor was once accompanied by ribald humor and rousing toasts, it is now usually part of a sermon or parable about Iomedae. Those who know him now can't fathom the life he led before. Likewise, those from a past life would be shocked to see him today.</p>\n<p><strong>Relationships</strong> Those of the faith deeply appreciate Jadren and his dedication to Iomedae's teachings. To outsiders, he can come off as preachy and self-righteous.</p>","attitude":"","backstory":"","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"<p><em>Elsir Syniras</em>: Jadren remembers little about Elsir, and continues to struggle to recall the sorcerer's name. To Jadren, Elsir always had a sour demeanor and kept to himself. Jadren thinks Elsir might have used magic in the past but isn't sure. In any case, Jadren is embarrassed that he doesn't remember more about those who served with him on the Brass Bird, and regrets having paid so little attention to others.</p>\n<p><em>Kaako Ashfeather:</em> Kaako and Jadren had a strained relationship. In his youth, Jadren used to invent nicknames for the tengu rogue, but he now looks back on them with embarrassment. She was skilled at her job and often kept the crew safe from curses. He realizes now that she didn't deserve to be teased.</p>\n<p><em>Lavanna Saltspray:</em> Jadren regards the halfling cleric of Gozreh highly. Even though his faith has taken a different course than hers, he can't help but reflect on their time together warmly. After all, she showed him the value of faith and conviction. Lavanna continually provided encouragement and laughter whenever he was down. For a time, Jadren even believed there might be something more to their relationship.</p>","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"class":{"value":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/assets/sheet/deity.webp","value":"Iomedae"},"ethnicity":{"value":"Taldan"},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"heritage":{"value":"Skilled"},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["common","halfling"]},"level":{"min":1,"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"rank":2,"value":0},"reflex":{"rank":2,"value":0},"will":{"rank":2,"value":0}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":2},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":2},"intimidation":{"rank":1},"medicine":{"rank":1},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":2},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.paizo-pregens.Actor.V31KjehELRbLRMeb"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"vCqYsDQ6UVN2fbNZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/elf.svg","items":[{"_id":"yQA1yamE5IFRMJBA","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Legal Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"M6HozHRP5PGGpZU4","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.nW1gi13E62Feto2w"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/woodland-elf.webp","name":"Woodland Elf","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Elf","slug":"elf","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.PgKmsA2aKdbLU6O0"},"description":{"value":"<p>You're adapted to life in the forest or the deep jungle, and you know how to climb trees and use foliage to your advantage.

Leshies are self-sufficient from the moment the ritual ends, and so they do not depend upon these druids for care, though</p>\n<p>Not all leshies have a strong enough spirit to strike off completely on their own, however. Weaker nature spirits can form only tenuous bonds that are just strong enough to animate Tiny bodies. These spirits become leshy familiars, acting as companions to their druid creators. Independent leshies are often protective of such leshy familiars, advocating for them to be treated with dignity and respect.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Act as a traveling agent for natural guardians who are unable to leave their territories.</li>\n<li>Encourage civilizations you encounter to cooperate with nature and build their cities in ecologically friendly ways.</li>\n<li>Become attached to new friends you make on your journeys.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think of you as a curiosity due to your spiritual origins.</li>\n<li>Judge you by your looks, treating you sweetly if you are cute or reacting with horror if you are frightening.</li>\n<li>Assume you know only about nature and are unfamiliar with civilization and society.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Leshies are as varied as the material used to create their vessels, usually appearing as a bizarre mishmash of various plants or fungi. Their bodies are vaguely humanoid in shape, with numerous characteristics of the plant or fungus from which they were made. A typical leshy is about 3 feet tall. Due to the nature of the ritual used to create a leshy, leshies begin their lives as adults. As spirits, they do not age, and a leshy could potentially remain in the same vessel foreverâ€”though leshies rarely consider this outcome to be desirable.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Though guardian leshies often congregate, traveling leshies are not naturally drawn to others of their own kind. To most leshies, the concept of family is not a matter of birth, but rather determined by bonds of loyalty and friendship. Leshies are dedicated allies, but they have little tolerance for those who would despoil nature. As much as they are happy to accept someone who earns their trust into their family, they expect family members to look out for them and their natural wards in return. A betrayed leshy might not directly attack those who slight them, but they might withdraw support at a critical moment or leave their betrayers to get lost in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>Leshies are grouped into categories akin to ethnicities, but these are not connected to physical features; rather, they represent broad categories of characteristics of their spirits. Certain spirits are more likely to gravitate toward particular physical bodies, though those familiar with leshies know that this predisposition is far from absolute. Leshies often take pride in their own appearances and appreciate beauty of all kinds in others, but they rarely form judgments based on physical appearance. Leshies' genders are determined by the spirits that inhabit their bodies. Leshies tend to gravitate toward plant bodies that match their genders. Some leshies are exclusively male or female, while many consider themselves both. Others, particularly fungus leshies, tend toward far more complex expressions of gender, or eschew the concept entirely.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>A leshy can be of any alignment, depending on what spirit inhabits their body, but their outlook often includes a neutral element. Religion is not particularly significant to most leshies. Those with a philosophical bent lean toward the Green Faith, and Gozreh is the most popular deity among faithful leshies. Some leshies also venerate green men, powerful spirits of nature that act as regional guardians.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Some backgrounds are particularly suitable for adventuring leshies, especially those backgrounds with a tie to the natural world, such as hunter, nomad, or scout. Nature-themed classes such as druid and ranger are popular choices for leshies. As druids, leshies gravitate toward the leaf order. Bard is also a good fit for leshies with a love of storytelling; such leshies often inhabit vine leshy bodies.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Leshies choose and change their names multiple times throughout their lives. These names often represent a facet of their personalities or values, though another common naming convention is to use descriptions of a natural feature they admire. Some leshies even use a cycle of names that changes to align with natural phenomena, such as names based upon the season or the time of day.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Scarlet in Summer, Verdant Taleweaver, Lurking Hunter, Masterful Sun Drinker, Noon Sky Evening Song, Snowy Pine Branch, Cascading Rapids</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Leshy Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Sylvan</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect.

You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h2>Spellbook</h2>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via Learn a Spell.

However, these reptilian opportunists prove happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it's to their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make their fortunes in the wider world.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Kobolds are resourceful survivors whose snare-guarded warrens and opportunistic scavenging have cast them as villains to most other humanoids, with their draconic reverence lending them a reputation as mere minions and nuisances. Yet some kobolds have emerged from their secluded warrens seeking the relative safety of surface settlements, the lucrative prospects of the adventuring life, or validating awe from followers of their own.</p>\n<p>If you want a character with oversized confidence, deadly cunning, and the ancient power of dragons flowing through their veins, you should play a kobold.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Take pride in your draconic connections, whether you believe dragons are your ancestors or simply patrons.</li>\n<li>Analyze your surroundings, always looking for ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.</li>\n<li>Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume that you are cowardly and won't stick around in the face of danger.</li>\n<li>Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness, especially when it comes to building defenses.</li>\n<li>Consider your claims of draconic power to be overblown, delusional, or endearing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall) reptilian humanoids with slender bodies and long tails. They often boast distant draconic ancestry, and every kobold displays one or more draconic features, such as stout horns, razor-sharp teeth, orâ€”more rarelyâ€”vestigial wings or draconic breath. They mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12 years and living to about 60.</p>\n<p>The color of a kobold's scales can vary widely. Most often, they mimic the hues of chromatic or metallic dragons, with a mix of slightly darker or lighter scales that create a mottled appearance. The scales of newly hatched kobolds often reflect the community's draconic exemplar, whether that's the dragon they currently serve or the dragon type from which they're descended.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them alive. They're secretive or subservient around powerful creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades once kobolds secure either a formidable patron (like a dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an artifact or sorcerous leader). They often achieve an unshakable fervor and loyalty to their new cause or leader. However, kobolds are infamous for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.</p>\n<p>Whether led by a dragon or not, kobolds almost always identify themselves with a type of dragon that serves as their spiritual exemplar. Their societies regularly adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by the exemplar's personality.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>All but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural respect for hierarchies and rules, and so kobolds are rarely chaotic. Kobold adventurers tend to be lawful neutral or neutral, relying on their ancestral social strategies for survival.</p>\n<p>Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds, especially when a deity assumes a commanding or tyrannical disposition. Many gravitate toward Abadar's order or Shelyn's artistic flair. More sinister communities uphold Asmodeus and other archdevils as common patrons. The dragon deities Apsu and Dahak are also common subjects of worship. Kobolds also often find themselves drawn to cults, particularly those with dragons or devils as figureheads.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Kobolds often adventure in pursuit of the power, lore, and treasure that they feel befit their disproportionately large egos. When adventurers, militias, or careless tyrants shatter a kobold community, the survivors often latch onto new families, seeking emotional solaceâ€”and sometimes revenge. Typical kobold backgrounds include artisan, artist, criminal, hunter, miner, scout, and tinker, plus bandit, cultist, scavenger, and servant. Kobolds excel as bards, rangers, rogues, and sorcerers, though they also often channel their ingenuity as alchemists or wizards.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>A young kobold's given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, kobolds add more syllables to their names, imitating a common draconic practice. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an effort to better fit into a community, in which case they typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that group.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Azrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn, Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka, Urkak, Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>PFS Note</strong> Due to years of successful Pathfinder Society activities, all characters have access to the kobold ancestry.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Kobold Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Constitution</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Draconic</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Though she originally turned to authority figures for help, Quizrel found out the hard way that a society that valued order and conformity over everything else often did little to aid its outcasts; more often than not, Quizrel would get in as much or more trouble for being victimized than her bullies would suffer for victimizing her. Eventually, Quizrel decided to try a different approach. The next time a group of kobolds surrounded her with ill intentions, she bit the ringleader right on the nose and refused to let go. Quizrel got in trouble for this too, but the bullying stopped. </span></p>\n<p>Yet this hard-learned lesson never sat well with Quizrel, and she struggled to fully embrace it. After a great deal of soul-searching, she came to two conclusions: first, it wasn't fair for other outcast kobolds to suffer like she did, and second, Quizrel didn't like getting in trouble. To this end, she threw herself into the study of warren laws, regulations, and punishments. She found every loophole that she could use to force the other kobolds to rule in her favor when conflicts arose. Armed with the power of knowledge, Quizrel was able to wrangle better treatment for kobold misfits, gaining a smug satisfaction from manipulating the authorities who had abandoned her into finally acting. And when the legal approach failed, a claw hammer to the face in a dark tunnel worked wonders. </span></p>\n<p>Quizrel's experiences have given her a casual disregard for rules and authority, despite having learned to wield both to her advantage. Nothing thrills Quizrel more than doing something forbidden and getting away with it. She constantly ignores curfews and no-go zones, sneaking out past warren guards and traps to explore off-limits areas of Absalom's underground and possibly pilfer a few treasures while she's there. Quizrel has ambitions of finally making it up to the surface of Absalom, walking among the people and streets and luxuries of the city, then making it back to tell the tale and fill her fellow kobolds with awe.</span></p>","attitude":"","backstory":"","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"class":{"value":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/assets/sheet/deity.webp","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"dex"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["aklo","common","draconic","sakvroth"]},"level":{"min":1,"value":1},"nationality":{"value":"Hookclaws"},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"rank":1,"value":0},"reflex":{"rank":2,"value":0},"will":{"rank":2,"value":0}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":1},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":1},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":1},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":1},"performance":{"rank":1},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":1},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.paizo-pregens.Actor.xgadoa9HjqMhrnvX"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"YNu4l7cjb580XM2K","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/dwarf.svg","items":[{"_id":"33KCg20Zb6cEzDoM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Absalom Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Gj2JT0oiUObMvApE","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Warfare Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":2},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Y8alBvs6eRIBSipZ","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.UV2sABrTC5teOXTE"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/strong-blooded-dwarf.webp","name":"Strong-Blooded Dwarf","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Dwarf","slug":"dwarf","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.BYj5ZvlXZdpaEgA6"},"description":{"value":"<p>Your blood runs hearty and strong, and you can shake off toxins.

With the Barbers, Kangir developed a taste for violence and brigandry that launched her career as a mercenary, and she's traveled the Inner Sea to serve countless scoundrels.

After interrogating and killing the hapless cutthroat, Kangir now knows her mysterious patron's identity: Doatara Kelorbeyan, a noblewoman who lives in the Petal District.

Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Casting spells with the unholy trait is almost always anathema to deities who don't allow unholy sanctification, and casting holy spells is likewise anathema to those who don't allow holy sanctification. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all cleric spellcasting.

The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in Cleric Spells per Day table above.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or for your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest rank of cleric spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"Dt0BzmA0BaTskLMu","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"rules":[],"slug":"cleric-spellcasting","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["cleric"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","effects":[]},{"_id":"C4GratQcCAqbZUtE","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.tyrBwBTzo5t9Zho7"},"flags":{"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"warpriest":{"id":"lEJkFnJk84cKMkGW","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"img":"icons/magic/symbols/question-stone-yellow.webp","name":"Doctrine","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Even among followers of the same deity, approaches vary.

One day, in order to save his own life during a battle with a Chelaxian pirate hunter, he took control of a cannon and sank the enemy ship, earning himself a promotion to full crewmember. He worked the cannons for a time and discovered he had a penchant for big guns and close-quarters combat, using his impressive size to lug weapons others found unwieldy.

These goblins rescued the hapless humans of Lastwall and escorting them to Absalom, where the humans gratefully rewarded the goblins by giving them the glorious Puddles district, a region of the city already filled with sturdy houses and even a castle for the goblins and their newly proclaimed king. Surrounded by such stories of goblin glory, Zakzak pushed himself constantly, crafting a firearm of unparalleled might in the form of his flingflenser, forged from scraps he scrounged himself from Absalom's back alleys.</p>\n<p>But even a mighty goblin with an even-mightier weapon needs an adventure before he can make his name. Hearing the stories of the gunslingers of Alkenstar, Zakzak boarded a ship for the port of Quantium, hoping to find passage from there on to Alkenstar. During the journey, Zakzak made an unlikely friend: an elven sniper named Zindarel. Despite the Jinin elf's best efforts to discourage the goblin, Zakzak knew a loner in need of a friend if ever he saw one. By the time their ship reached port the two had forged a bond that Zakzak knew was a lifelong friendship and that Zindarel found surprisingly tolerable. Together, the two traveled on to Alkenstar in search of adventure and opportunity.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/assets/sheet/deity.webp","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":[]},"level":{"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"proficiencies":{"attacks":{"weapon-group-firearm":{"custom":true,"rank":2}}},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{"will":{"rank":2}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":1},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":2},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.paizo-pregens.Actor.yzcXrMEuajAdIRZE"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"zo0OV4kxZ4LntHkU","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/strix.svg","items":[{"_id":"lVcvisdO56v5pJ0R","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Devil Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"NbEOqZpnbrULuD0R","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Korvosa Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"5Ktdn48UnWRd9cyD","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.9mS8EGLlGUOzSAzP"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/heritage.svg","name":"Nightglider Strix","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Strix","slug":"strix","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.GXcC6oVa5quzgNHD"},"description":{"value":"<p>You are a dedicated nocturnal avian, keeping watch and predating in the most lightless environments.
