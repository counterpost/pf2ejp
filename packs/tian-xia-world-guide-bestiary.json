The Great Flood towers with their giant serpent body and nine humanoid heads, each one with a different personality, though all serve the same purpose—to vanquish all signs of life that shouldn't be where they are. This creature intends to maintain the balance of the universe, ensuring that nothing takes up more space than necessary. Unfortunately, the judgment of where someone or something should be is only seen and weighed by the 18 eyes of the Great Flood, with little regard to mortal input.</p>\n<p>The Great Flood is an immortal, or at least ageless, being who hibernates for 12 years at a stretch. On the thirteenth year, they emerge from the depths of the oceans and begin weighing the state of the world and the environments closest to their resting place: should the first thing they see on dry land be destroyed? Each of the Great Flood's nine heads lends their thoughts and insights to this deliberation, and upon reaching a consensus, they'll either carry on to the next location or they'll drown the land, immersing miles of dry land in salty waters from the ocean. In instances where they perceive the excess life as particularly problematic, they'll even decide to poison the waters with their bitter breath to ensure that nothing survives the judgment they've decreed. The Great Flood, despite its inherently destructive nature, isn't actually bloodthirsty and will often afford an opportunity for poor townsfolk to state their case and beg for the lives of their town to be saved. While the Great Flood has the capacity for mercy and consideration, the godlike creature stands adamant once they've made their decision. One or two of the heads might feel a twinge of guilt and tell a small joke to the townsfolk, relieving themselves of the mental pressure, before murdering an entire village.</p>\n<p>The nine personalities of the serpentine creature often run into contention with each other. One is a perfectionist, while another is aloof; one is assertive, while another is playful; one is capricious, while another is suspicious; one is ambitious, while the other is a people pleaser. The last one is quiet and secretive, only ever whispering to the heads closest to them. Though the heads squabble like siblings, they eventually always make a compromise.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Lost Omens: Tian Xia World Guide"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 120 feet","mod":39,"senses":[]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":37},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":32},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":33}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":38},"deception":{"base":33},"diplomacy":{"base":33},"intimidation":{"base":38},"nature":{"base":31},"performance":{"base":29},"society":{"base":33}},"traits":{"rarity":"unique","size":{"value":"grg"},"value":["amphibious","beast"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.lost-omens-tian-xia-world-guide.Actor.3utPtrLWLyNO1hxt"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"6bACPcPqi8syNcVg","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"wuxLsndHxEuyThiy","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Primal Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":25,"value":17},"tradition":{"value":"primal"},"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"KbFfnSGDNYx2BZYL","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.A2JfEKe6BZcTG1S8"},"img":"icons/creatures/mammals/bats-movement-flying-black.webp","name":"Fly","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>The target can soar through the air, gaining a fly Speed equal to its Speed or 20 feet, whichever is greater.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.MuRBCiZn5IKeaoxi]{Spell Effect: Fly}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The duration increases to 1 hour.</p>"},"duration":{"sustained":false,"value":"5 minutes"},"level":{"value":4},"location":{"heightenedLevel":4,"value":"wuxLsndHxEuyThiy"},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"range":{"value":"touch"},"requirements":"","rules":[],"slug":"fly","target":{"value":"1 creature"},"time":{"value":"2"},"traits":{"rarity":"common","traditions":["arcane","divine","occult","primal"],"value":["concentrate","manipulate"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spell","effects":[]},{"_id":"DgYO9gHv62aAmpdQ","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.MZGkMsPBztFN0pUO"},"img":"icons/magic/water/elemental-water.webp","name":"Water Breathing","sort":300000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>The targets can breathe underwater.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> The duration increases to 8 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> The duration increases to until your next daily preparations.</p>"},"duration":{"sustained":false,"value":"1 hour"},"level":{"value":2},"location":{"heightenedLevel":4,"value":"wuxLsndHxEuyThiy"},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"range":{"value":"30 feet"},"requirements":"","rules":[],"slug":"water-breathing","target":{"value":"up to 5 creatures"},"time":{"value":"1 minute"},"traits":{"rarity":"common","traditions":["arcane","divine","primal"],"value":["concentrate","manipulate","water"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spell","effects":[]},{"_id":"DJ1QM3taS8D2B2kr","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.gpzpAAAJ1Lza2JVl"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/detect-magic.webp","name":"Detect Magic","sort":400000,"system":{"area":{"type":"emanation","value":30},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic.

Its heavenly origins and love of wealth may be the reason why imperial dragons have cared for them since time immemorial, valuing them as guardians and loyal companions. In particular, underworld dragons employ pixius to expand their hoards, and many sovereign dragons value them as status symbols.

Manananggals use their long, hollow tongues to drain victims' blood from vital organs such as the liver, and the resulting odd drainage marks make it difficult to determine the exact nature of a victim's death.

Although this large, solitary beast bears a slight resemblance to the common draft ox, it's a highly aggressive and territorial carnivore who stalks and devours its prey. An aoyin dwells high in the mountains, rarely being seen by common folk. However, during lean winters, an aoyin might descend from its mountain home in search of food, resulting in gruesome encounters with nearby settlements. It's believed that a single aoyin can decimate the population of an entire village, only to retreat into the nearby mountains once it has satiated its hunger. An aoyin, even a herd of the creatures, is primarily driven by hunger and other natural urges. Outside of its natural habitat, an aoyin might occasionally be kept by those who revel in bloodlust. Even with magical control, a captive aoyin is more likely to turn on its handlers than obey commands. As an uncontrolled weapon, however, a hungry aoyin poses a terrible threat to most communities. Tales in certain isolated areas claim that the growling call of an aoyin can drive those unlucky enough to hear it into a frenzy of hunger and violence. Villages will be found consumed by infighting without any sign of an aoyin even entering its borders. Although it's possible a powerful variant of this creature might possess this ability, most of these stories are inspired by the terrible magic available to those who understand the aoyin's secrets and are spread when villages collapse through magic compulsions or mundane infighting.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Lost Omens: Tian Xia World Guide"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"bloodsense (precise) 60 feet, low light vision, scent (precise) 30 feet","mod":19,"senses":[]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":22},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":18},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":16}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":21},"stealth":{"base":18},"survival":{"base":19,"special":[{"base":21,"label":"in mountains","predicate":["terrain:mountain"]}]}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["animal"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.lost-omens-tian-xia-world-guide.Actor.Lhcwzt64Do7afrbF"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"mu36UlW90zHYuzww","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"FRCfXLJnF3Vn2xRI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Spring","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"value":[]},"bonus":{"value":8},"damageRolls":{"IgIxZNl0r8QewRVq":{"damage":"1d6+1","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":["finesse"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"iWS9YadXqt4xiyRH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Bite","sort":200000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"value":[]},"bonus":{"value":6},"damageRolls":{"90rdpNb4JWolKv1w":{"damage":"1d8+1","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":[]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"m2FEyBD2J8tnbsY5","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.qCCLZhnp2HhP3Ex6"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Darkvision","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Darkvision]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Monster Core"},"rules":[],"slug":"darkvision","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"JzTEt5sRabapeyla","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Hopping Strike","sort":400000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":2},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p>The hopping head Leaps 15 feet and makes one spring Strike at any point during that movement, dealing an additional @Damage[1d6[bludgeoning]] damage.</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[{"damageType":"bludgeoning","diceNumber":1,"dieSize":"d6","key":"DamageDice","predicate":["hopping"],"selector":"spring-damage"},{"domain":"damage","key":"RollOption","option":"hopping","toggleable":true}],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]}],"name":"Hopping Head","system":{"abilities":{"cha":{"mod":1},"con":{"mod":0},"dex":{"mod":3},"int":{"mod":-1},"str":{"mod":1},"wis":{"mod":2}},"attributes":{"ac":{"details":"","value":14},"allSaves":{"value":""},"hp":{"details":"","max":25,"temp":0,"value":25},"speed":{"otherSpeeds":[],"value":20},"weaknesses":[{"exceptions":[],"type":"electricity","value":2},{"exceptions":[],"type":"orichalcum","value":2}]},"details":{"blurb":"","languages":{"details":"","value":["sakvroth","tien"]},"level":{"value":1},"privateNotes":"","publicNotes":"<p>A hopping head is shaped like a humanoid head, sometimes with elaborate facial features, other times with a crude toylike visage.

True or not, jiidons are seemingly normal rats who share the blessing from this story. It's unclear where the first jiidon was born because their descendants live among rat and humanoid populations around the world. In their original forms, jiidons are extremely difficult to distinguish from an ordinary rat and often even finds a home leading its non-sapient kin.</p>\n<p>After eating the discarded fingernails of a humanoid, however, a jiidon can assume the shape of the clippings' owner, resembling the subject in all of the obvious and superficial ways, with several subtle differences. Their ears are a little larger and sometimes come to a small point. Their teeth continue to grow for their entire lifetimes, so they must regularly chew on stones, bark, and other hard materials to file their teeth down and conceal their true nature. The whiskers that grow from the sides of their faces also require daily trimming.</p>\n<p>Jiidons are mostly harmless, but their powers provoke alarm among those who know of them. Mothers scold their children not to clip their nails after nightfall, lest a lurking jiidon seize a sliver that got lost in the dark. Though as cautious as any rat, most jiidons want nothing more than to transform and take a place in humanoid society. In order to reduce suspicion, they've been known to target those who are unpopular among their neighbors. The gratitude they feel when they do replace a humanoid can sometimes be seen in their actions, revealing the fact that the target has been replaced or endearing jiidons to those who didn't appreciate the original's attitude.</p>\n<p>Jiidons from large families will often seek a role that grants them access to nail trimmings, such as a cleaner or doctor, and pass the gift of humanoid form through the family.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Lost Omens: Tian Xia World Guide"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"darkvision","mod":10,"senses":[]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":12},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":13},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":9}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":11},"deception":{"base":9},"stealth":{"base":11}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["beast"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.lost-omens-tian-xia-world-guide.Actor.n9LLGRKgPI8fDRBk"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"pcs9Shzxhu62xL4V","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"4hydF91VfWHUu3Kk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Floral Camouflage","sort":100000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>When Hiding, the orchid mantis swarm is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} by any amount of leaves or petals, even if they aren't thick enough to make other creatures concealed.</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"rd7ujmlpzHNPoAUa","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.fFu2sZz4KB01fVRc"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Low-Light Vision","sort":200000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.LowLightVision]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Monster Core"},"rules":[],"slug":"low-light-vision","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"x1EGmJfRYmTo2DrQ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Biting Blossom","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":1},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p>Each enemy in the swarm's space takes @Damage[3d6[piercing]] damage (@Check[reflex|dc:24|basic] save).

If either you or the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points, any damage from this spell is resolved and then the spell ends.</p>"},"duration":{"sustained":false,"value":"10 minutes"},"level":{"value":2},"location":{"heightenedLevel":2,"uses":{"max":99,"value":99},"value":"hkSAsypAIASowsRA"},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"range":{"value":"30 feet"},"requirements":"","rules":[],"slug":"share-life","target":{"value":"1 creature"},"time":{"value":"2"},"traits":{"rarity":"common","traditions":["divine"],"value":["concentrate","manipulate"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spell","effects":[]},{"_id":"CunZIYjtmEWe7iFQ","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.rqfnQ5VHT5hxm25r"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Scent (Imprecise) 120 feet","sort":500000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Scent]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Monster Core"},"rules":[],"slug":"scent","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"veEPmtQps9ORlQi9","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.qCCLZhnp2HhP3Ex6"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Darkvision","sort":600000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Darkvision]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Monster Core"},"rules":[],"slug":"darkvision","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"hsZMLMNQaHXc695x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Watch over Evil","sort":700000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within 30 feet of the aso berang Casts a Spell</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The aso berang makes a spectral flame Strike against the triggering creature.

Their visages have inspired various tusked demon masks used for great festivals across Tian Xia. These beasts are known as aso berangs, or bear dogs, in the islands of Minata. As their name suggests, they resemble large canines with the bulk of a bear. However, aso berangs aren't simply large and charismatic animals, for many say they're the kings of forest spirits and patrons of guardians. They're often revered as protective entities by those who live outside the woods they guard. These guardians only appear to common folk if the forest they live in is in danger or if they need something. When they do so, aso berangs can appear as large and powerful humans who emanate a regal presence. Aso berangs have wickedly sharp talons that shed regularly, and they're strong enough to climb trees in pursuit of witches who attempt to escape up them. Very often, aso berangs attack visitors whose hearts they deem impure or those they consider as potential threats to their forest. Unfortunately, receiving this judgment usually takes little more than forgetting to perform the proper rites of respect and reverence.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Lost Omens: Tian Xia World Guide"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 120 feet","mod":23,"senses":[]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":25},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":25},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":27}},"skills":{"arcana":{"base":21},"athletics":{"base":25},"intimidation":{"base":23},"nature":{"base":25},"occultism":{"base":21},"religion":{"base":25}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["spirit"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.lost-omens-tian-xia-world-guide.Actor.zrx1qjf1WbSYllvz"},"effects":[]}]
