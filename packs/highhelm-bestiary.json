reptiles with scales in a checkered gold and white pattern, draft lizards sport powerful jaws and even stronger backs capable of hauling loads four times their own weight. Native to the underground tunnels of the Five Kings Mountains, the reptiles have been domesticated to serve as beasts of burden within the Depths and sprawling web of passages beyond. Zoologists theorize that they are a part of the same reptile family as zetogekis, as the two share a similar build and other physical characteristics.</p>\n<p>Draft lizards within the vicinity of Highhelm have adapted their diet to feed mainly on grindlegrubs. However, residual behavior suggests in lean times or before domestication they would devour stones for sustenance. The animals can still be observed habitually gnawing on boulders or large stones, cracking them with their powerful jaws and seeming to savor the taste as they roll the debris around in their mouths. Overworked draft lizards will stray from their handler's control in order to consume rocks, only to return back to their path with a new undercurrent of purpose.</p>\n<p>Normally as docile as any other beast of burden, the draft lizards of Highhelm will defend themselves if attacked by predators from the Darklands. Curiously, the lizards have an intense hatred for hryngars, attacking them without any prompting or hesitation. No dwarven records indicate teaching this behavior during the domestication of the animals, leaving its origins a mystery. Some caravanners even claim that the reptiles can sense the presence of hryngars, giving advanced warning of attacks by hissing menacingly into the darkness.</p>\n<p>Though too large to be exceptionally dexterous, with careful training some draft lizards can be taught performative tricks. The Rolling Wheel is particularly known for a trio of reptiles that balance on their tails, catch hurled boulders in their jaws, and other stunts. The spectacle is well known in Highhelm, considered one of the big acts that the group performs.

Unlike mules found elsewhere on Golarion, augdunars are capable of producing offspring—though significantly fewer than ordinary equines. This has led to a steady, but controlled, stock of the creatures, allowing for the population to be selfsustaining. Augdunars are smaller than typical mules to accommodate dwarven height, measuring about four and a half feet tall and weighing between 400 and 600 pounds.</p>\n<p>Because of their ability to carry loads beyond that of the traditional mule, in addition to the ability to breed amongst themselves, augdunars are a frequent target of thieves or opportunistic merchants. No Highhelm citizen worth their stone willingly sells an augdunar to outsiders, so attempted thefts on the road are common. Unfortunately for these robbers, the mules are quite loyal to their owners and bray loudly whenever a stranger handles their leads. Combined with a heavy kick to the skull from the animal, any attempts to make off with an augdunar have low odds of succeeding.</p>\n<p>While rare, small groups of the augdunar have broken away from dwarven control over the years and created feral colonies in the Five Kings Mountains. These colonies are largely safe from ordinary predators, such as wolves, and graze on mountainside plants. Due to their low birthrate, feral augdunars don't need to have their population controlled, though caravanners do attempt to capture and redomesticate them in an effort to increase profit.</p>\n<p>Despite being natural beasts of burden, dwarves don't often use augdunars as mounts. The mules seem to have an instinctive dislike of riders, to which the deep bite marks and hoofprints left in those who try can attest. That's not to say that some haven't succeeded, however. Those who put forth the effort required to create a bond with an augdunar find that their persistence can pay off. Augdunar loyalty is unparalleled and even thieves know to not attempt to steal an augdunar that's carrying a rider.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Lost Omens: Highhelm"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":11},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":6},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":8}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":8},"survival":{"base":6}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["animal"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.lost-omens-highhelm-bestiary.Actor.cWHQmwUkLYBlFOGX"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"fQvTnIpC2Wq1U32z","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"HOGEXvBEDcFtSi2w","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["grab"]},"bonus":{"value":18},"damageRolls":{"h2ctnL4NJZog2BK1":{"damage":"2d10+9","damageType":"piercing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":["reach-10"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"AmJWxAaznWrR7cT5","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":200000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"value":[]},"bonus":{"value":18},"damageRolls":{"ZNTIYS2gTOGtY6dy":{"damage":"2d6+9","damageType":"slashing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":["agile"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"lYSJkzGiccxyMfdz","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tail","sort":300000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["tail-impalement"]},"bonus":{"value":16},"damageRolls":{"WpBrExa43RQs9zHG":{"damage":"2d8+6","damageType":"piercing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":["reach-15"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"a4gNBJxZRt38w9KE","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Spit","sort":400000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["blinding-spittle"]},"bonus":{"value":16},"damageRolls":{},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":["range-30"]},"weaponType":{"value":"ranged"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"a7SkSojOBCMbEEq5","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Blinding Spittle","sort":500000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p>A creature hit by a pagulin's spit must attempt a @Check[fortitude|dc:22] save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 round.
