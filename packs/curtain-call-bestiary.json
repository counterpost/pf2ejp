Since desert giants' journeys across the wastes can span weeks or even months at a time, an individual who can make their companions laugh with a witty joke or amusing parable remains a prized member of the community.</p>\n<p>Desert giants stand 15 feet tall, tending toward lean physiques that are ideal for traveling across vast expanses of sand for long sojourns.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Many kinds of giants lurk in the inhospitable corners of the world, making their homes in unlikely locales ranging from fetid sinkholes and ruined battlefields to mass graveyards and barren badlands.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder #204: Stage Fright"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":19,"senses":[]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":18},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":21},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":15}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":21},"intimidation":{"base":15},"survival":{"base":19}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["giant","humanoid","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.curtain-call-bestiary.Actor.aYilwFsxQZkdqv6z"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"BgPshRvqaBvy4ulr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"zAk0pdQOawlWdqtR","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Prepared Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"prepared"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slots":{"slot0":{"max":5,"prepared":[{"id":"8fkq8HgRvV8e92Ag"},{"id":"lf6UEaHmLPB3MfmD"},{"id":"BppMJG7W4pSfjhsq"},{"id":"7w44zHnMQ2z0YGYG"},{"id":"Ceox2WeCSPgSNJZf"}]},"slot1":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"G9vtMlDFZpXK3SwX"},{"id":"1cwWdHnEumpkvnTJ"},{"id":"6Jks2QzplFnJ3qQY"}]},"slot2":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"wYkT5BE2d1n3BC5M"},{"id":"9d11pNtnjV7Hk2Xe"},{"id":"op3YStyaAJaLCYgd"}]},"slot3":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"vKAHa2WvGL01ekNj"},{"id":"vKAHa2WvGL01ekNj"},{"id":"I5k4L5LFTu6tbQfx"}]},"slot4":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"f0Y6vJehiX1mfpXO"},{"id":"JdtETMWIGYH16FYS"},{"id":"7eeybrk29d9DGHHm"}]},"slot5":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"7rC7zG16sty5V5Cw"},{"id":"G9vtMlDFZpXK3SwX"},{"id":"7vqRjXxc2OmknduS"}]},"slot6":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"7eeybrk29d9DGHHm"},{"id":"U7sxFMKFFgDVyR8X"},{"id":"0OpcTqJnsYRe77vF"}]},"slot7":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"nCpr0AutmVQayFz7"},{"id":"JEyjzX8zgcqbIuYE"},{"id":"t2cw9CImGzVYWYyY"}]},"slot8":{"max":2,"prepared":[{"id":"7eeybrk29d9DGHHm"},{"id":"DddLopRkJiuUFMWq"}]}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":36,"value":28},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"zA0Ann6s0LvkZMPJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":36,"value":28},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"nCpr0AutmVQayFz7","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.sX2o0HH4RjJDAZ8C"},"img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-sealed-signatures-red.webp","name":"Divine Decree","sort":300000,"system":{"area":{"type":"emanation","value":40},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{"0":{"applyMod":false,"category":null,"formula":"7d10","kinds":["damage"],"materials":[],"type":"spirit"}},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"fortitude"}},"description":{"value":"<p>You utter a potent litany from your faith, a mandate that harms those who oppose your ideals.

At first glance, kishis appear to be attractive humans, usually of a local ethnicity, but their full heads of thick hair conceal a second face: that of a snarling hyena.

Although kishis can cast charm to make unwitting companions complacent, most of these sinister creatures prefer to trick their prey using guile, gifts, and their dashing good looks. These ultimate sadists derive pleasure from the thrill of the hunt as well as the delicious reward at the end. The more uptight, prudish, or haughty a target, the better-for nothing satisfies kishis as much as earning (and destroying) the trust of someone who rarely grants it.</p>\n<p>When kishis get their new friends or lovers alone, they choose the most dramatic moments to reveal their true monstrous forms and clamp their jaws down on their victim. Kishis have no desire to share their true nature with the entire community, so they typically aim for the throats of their victims, who can no longer cry out for help after being cut off from air. Kishis consume every part of their victims' bodies, leaving no trace of the crime-even lapping up any spilled blood, claiming the victim's treasures as their own, and cleaning the murder scene as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Few things can bind a community together as swiftly as uncovering a kishi.

They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.</p>\n<p>Depending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands.

They are most often found defending ancient temples and religious artifacts with zealous fervor. Some believe they were created by a long-dead god millennia ago to act as guardians, but girtablilus consider the subject of their origin taboo and refuse to address the theory.</p>\n<p>Because girtablilus accept a wide range of religions and belief systems, some outsiders believe they also worship their own ancient pantheon. Instead, girtablilus exclusively revere and protect sites dedicated to deities considered lost to civilization. In this way, they act as preservers of holy practices that have otherwise been forgotten beneath the desert's shifting sands.</p>\n<p>Though girtablilus are used to explorers seeking entrance to the sites they defend, they might welcome those who earnestly wish to learn or offer reverence. A few even proudly share their beliefs with others, eager for the opportunity to preach to someone new. But girtablilus show no mercy to those who attempt to desecrate the sites and objects of their worship, or to those who would violate the tenets of their faith.</p>\n<p>Girtablilus are skilled fighters who keep trained giant scorpions as pets, and they remain unmatched when it comes to fighting in the desert.

In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder #204: Stage Fright"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":18,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":15},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":18},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":14}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":14},"deception":{"base":18},"intimidation":{"base":18},"occultism":{"base":12},"stealth":{"base":18}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["dream","incorporeal"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.curtain-call-bestiary.Actor.WFZpAABKj85MK8y8"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"wJTI5OsZaV7n2VUp","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","items":[{"_id":"eVG7aoeiHppf0eQN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Deny Passage","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"free"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature attempts to enter or exit the manor through a window or exterior door</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The barrier blasts the triggering creature with devastating sound, ringing out like a thunderous low-pitched gong;
