Despite this expanded intellect, many bakenekos prefer to enjoy the first decades of their ascension continuing their lives as usual as a (particularly oversized) house cat.

They often animate corpses simply to watch them dance—a pastime that often spells trouble for nearby settlements should the undead get free from the bakeneko's control. Bakenekos typically have a playful and mischievous demeanor, and while they aren't inherently evil creatures, they're still feared for their ability to animate corpses and command fire. Villagers are often frightened half to death by the sight of a flaming cat strolling alongside a walking corpse, and bakenekos' association with evil and the occult has caused some villages in Tian Xia to vilify all cats.</p>\n<h2>Nekomatas</h2>\n<p>Bakenekos mostly see their animated but mindless zombies as amusements, though they also use them as guardians or even as agents for revenge. Still, they do their best to ensure that undead they animate aren't left to wander free. Most tales of \"evil bakenekos\" in fact refer to a similar and much more dangerous creature, the nekomata—a level 6 Medium-sized variant of the bakeneko whose bite causes a debilitating disease of the mind.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #197: Let the Leaves Fall"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":9,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":30,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":8},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":4}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":10},"deception":{"base":8},"occultism":{"base":8},"stealth":{"base":10},"thievery":{"base":10}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"sm"},"value":["beast","chaotic"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.season-of-ghosts-bestiary.Actor.BK4gQmGPX4BW4hyb"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"BQvtFFZIfICblybJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"bOe2DBNsKt2ZttfX","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Spectral Hand","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["drain-life"]},"bonus":{"value":21},"damageRolls":{"0":{"damage":"2d10+7","damageType":"mental"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["finesse"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"u12odfdEyxk5GPY5","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.sebk9XseMCRkDqRg"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Lifesense 60 feet","sort":200000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Lifesense]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"},"rules":[],"slug":"lifesense","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"yH19s0CEMs71KZgv","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.kquBnQ0kObZztnBc"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"+1 Status to All Saves vs. Vitality","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[{"key":"FlatModifier","predicate":["vitality"],"selector":"saving-throw","type":"status","value":1}],"slug":"1-status-to-all-saves-vs-magic","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"flCrHBNNesdvv5af","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.hFtNbo1LKYCoDy2O"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","name":"Attack of Opportunity","sort":400000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.AttackOfOpportunity]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"},"rules":[],"slug":"attack-of-opportunity","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"AytjsrleVTlWADIi","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Draining Presence","sort":500000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>10 feet.

Some eventually succumb to that fate, while others eventually rejoin the River of Souls. Until then, these wandering souls are a kind unto themselves-one without a true home, agenda, or purpose.</p>\n<p>Many phantoms have no desire to remain in their strange state of purgatory, either because they seek to continue their journey through the River of Souls or because they fear the corruption of undeath. In order to complete the natural spiritual cycle and become judged so they can continue to the afterlife, a phantom must simply find a way back into the River of Souls. Such a quest is no easy feat, however-the hazy mists of the Ethereal Plane can befuddle even the most experienced traveler, and numerous predators prowl the realm in search of stray souls to bind or devour.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #196: The Summer That Never Was"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":0,"value":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":5},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":8}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":7},"intimidation":{"base":6}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["ethereal","evil","incorporeal","phantom","spirit"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.season-of-ghosts-bestiary.Actor.I9BbG4LH6LP4zlhK"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"IdbrdikgvRguKYNE","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"x47iDfIE9albveGl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Shadow Hand","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":[]},"bonus":{"value":15},"damageRolls":{"0":{"damage":"2d6+3","damageType":"void"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["finesse","magical"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ACHlnYzXVxizzqPw","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Light Vulnerability","sort":200000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>An object shedding magical light (such as from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.WBmvzNDfpwka3qT4]{Light} spell) is treated as magical when used to attack the shadow.</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"pqLc5YtEMVdohgdE","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Infest Shadow","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p>When a familiar shadow pulls free the shadow of the PC that they duplicate, it twists and writhes for a moment before it immediately slithers back around the character.

This hunger drives the meokdan to constantly seek food and often compels them to eat dirt, stones, and refuse that offer little (if any) nutritional value. Regardless of how much they eat, a meokdan always remains painfully thin in stature. Regardless of how hungry they get, they never starve to death.</p>\n<p>A meokdan's emaciated frame appears human in shape, with thick, tangled hair that grows directly from their face as well as the rest of their head, leaving only the meokdan's gaping mouth visible. Their arms appear to be broken and unnaturally long, with equally long fingers tipped with ragged nails. Small, open sores pockmark their skin.</p>\n<p>Meokdans epitomize the cycle of food, from consumption to the creature themselves being consumed in the end, be it by predators or the environment growing from their remains.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When an evil mortal soul that has been reincarnated multiple times is wrenched from the cycle of souls and corrupted, it can undergo a horrific transformation into a fiend known as a nindoru. A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.</p>\n<p>Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.</p>\n<p>Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane.</p>\n<h2>Reincarnated Souls</h2>\n<p>In some cases, you'll know if a creature a nindoru attacks has a reincarnated soul. Ancestries like samsarans are always reincarnated souls, and a PC's backstory or even their background can often indicate the presence of a previous life. All of the PCs in Season of Ghosts qualify as reincarnated souls, as they've relived their lives over and over for decades. If you ever need to determine if a creature's soul is reincarnated for the purpose of adjudicating a nindoru's ability, attempt a @Check[flat|dc:11]—on a success, it has a reincarnated soul.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Demigods</h2>\n<p>The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as \"nindoru ascetics.\"</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Traitors</h2>\n<p>While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these \"traitors\" are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Butterflies</h2>\n<p>One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air.</p>\n<h2>Other Nindorus</h2>\n<p>Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse-copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus).</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #197: Let the Leaves Fall"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":9,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":5},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":9}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":8},"deception":{"base":7},"intimidation":{"base":7},"occultism":{"base":6}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["chaotic","evil","fiend","nindoru","unholy"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.season-of-ghosts-bestiary.Actor.k77t59tuHjiDEXRm"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"k9JJEqd1G2EB27Gd","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","items":[{"_id":"SXHCmyJ4M2Nm3Oqg","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Summon Vanths","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> One of the PCs enters the room and is noticed by the hazard</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The trap summons four vanths, who then roll initiative and remain for up to 1 minute before the spell ends and the vanths disappear.

These vengeful thatchlings appear to wear red hoods when viewed at a distance, but up close, the grisly truth—that their heads are blood-soaked—is revealed. Unlike other thatchlings, red-hooded thatchlings are skilled at trickery, and their ability to appear as a living humanoid through illusion magic allows them to lure the unexpected into ambushes much more easily.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In rural Shenmen, some branches of Sangpotshi warn of what can happen if a soul bound for reincarnation is prevented from entering the River of Souls and rejoining the cycle. These souls become frustrated, confused, and then furious at what they feel is a denial of the body they deserve, and in turn, they force vegetation to serve as their new body. Others theorize that when a body is buried in a shallow grave, the roots of grass growing down into the remains can tangle the soul and capture it.</p>\n<p>Thatchlings are intelligent and capable of speaking but rarely do so—they generally have little to say to those whose lives they covet.

Of course, since each year \"resets\" things, those who died during the year and became thatchlings are reborn alive once more on every first day of summer, with no memories of their previous doomed existence. While still driven by instinct to attack the living, Willowshore's thatchlings do feel a sense of remorse—if the GM judges it especially appropriate, they might take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and saving throws against creatures they knew in life.</p>\n<h2>Forever Senseless</h2>\n<p>The thatchling's curse robs the sense of direction from those it falls upon, leading to a whole category of insults in Shenmen that compare someone's ability to get something done to \"a thatchling's sense.\" For example, someone who has a hard time making friends might be said to have \"a thatchling's sense of friendship,\" while someone who constantly ruins meals might be said to have \"a thatchling's kitchen sense.\"</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #196: The Summer That Never Was"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":6},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":8}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":7},"deception":{"base":8},"stealth":{"base":7,"special":[{"base":9,"label":"in undergrowth","predicate":["terrain:undergrowth"]}]}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"sm"},"value":["chaotic","evil","undead","unholy"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.season-of-ghosts-bestiary.Actor.N69YhHyRWfpfvESy"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"nclfSsutwosyGxUX","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","items":[{"_id":"enIVqYma3DMIu6fz","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Reaction","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Initiative is rolled at the start of a combat where the PCs face a type of foe they have fought before</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> As the combat begins, everything suddenly feels distorted and dreamlike.

It uses your spell attack modifier for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC – 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes @Damage[3d4[mental]] damage. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the image or uses the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

Born from souls who were once enlightened but then renounced it and their role in the cycle of reincarnation, they curse the futility of their existence and find pleasure in leading others to the same fate.</p>\n<p>Ijdas appear as towering humanoids, their bodies bloated and constantly bursting with small red butterflies that flitter away before melting into mist. Their arms are overly long and so broken as to writhe more like tentacles, affording them an unsettling combat style with greater reach than most large creatures enjoy. They wear clothing and capes made of moldy straw and wield broken swords whose shattered blades still float roughly in place. Their most unsettling features are their complete lack of heads; instead, where a head should be sits a wicker cage filled with a writhing cloud of butterflies. Yet still, they see, hear, and speak without issue, as if their heads remained in place.</p>\n<p>Formed without heads or even brains, an idja's mind is shared among the flocks of butterflies in their head cages or bursting from their bodies, and as each of these insects escapes and fades away, these forgetful fiends lose another potential thought. Unable to learn new things, any actions they take stem from memories etched into their souls or directives they blindly follow from other nindorus or creatures they've come to accept as superiors. Their movements, words, and reactions are all conducted via a type of muscle memory based on how their souls believe they should respond to their external stimuli. As a result, most now serve as brutal guardians, since their forgetfulness also prevents them from being able to sleep.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When an evil mortal soul that has been reincarnated multiple times is wrenched from the cycle of souls and corrupted, it can undergo a horrific transformation into a fiend known as a nindoru. A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.</p>\n<p>Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.</p>\n<p>Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane.</p>\n<h2>Reincarnated Souls</h2>\n<p>In some cases, you'll know if a creature a nindoru attacks has a reincarnated soul. Ancestries like samsarans are always reincarnated souls, and a PC's backstory or even their background can often indicate the presence of a previous life. All of the PCs in Season of Ghosts qualify as reincarnated souls, as they've relived their lives over and over for decades. If you ever need to determine if a creature's soul is reincarnated for the purpose of adjudicating a nindoru's ability, attempt a @Check[flat|dc:11]—on a success, it has a reincarnated soul.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Demigods</h2>\n<p>The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as \"nindoru ascetics.\"</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Traitors</h2>\n<p>While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these \"traitors\" are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Butterflies</h2>\n<p>One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air.</p>\n<h2>Other Nindorus</h2>\n<p>Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse-copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus).</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #197: Let the Leaves Fall"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":15,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":15},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":13},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":12}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":16}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["chaotic","evil","fiend","nindoru","unholy"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.season-of-ghosts-bestiary.Actor.QCTOHTwnEo6eq82T"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Qmg2GRJivmrKxJ4C","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"2Lq6UurzQcaADstE","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":24,"value":16},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"uwOsWnnld7R6J0Xz","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.2oH5IufzdESuYxat"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/illusory-object.webp","name":"Illusory Object","sort":200000,"system":{"area":{"type":"burst","value":20},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object.

When faced with a famine that threatened their existence, these ancestors each cut out one of their eyes as an offering to the malevolent spirits of the forest, imploring for their salvation.

The judged soul moves onto its appropriate domain of final rest-Heaven, Hell, Abaddon, and so forth-where it becomes a petitioner.</p>\n<p>Complications arise, however, when a soul in queue for judgment prematurely departs from the River of Souls and is shunted into the Ethereal Plane. Whether as a result of nefarious interlopers like night hags, malignant planar magic, or even fate, these souls become dislodged from the natural order of life and death and linger in a sort of purgatory. Unlike petitioners, these ethereal phantoms retain memories of their life before death, and unlike spirits such as ghosts, phantoms aren't tinged with the foul influences of undeath-at least, not at first, though the threat of corruption hangs heavy over a phantom's existence. Some eventually succumb to that fate, while others eventually rejoin the River of Souls. Until then, these wandering souls are a kind unto themselves-one without a true home, agenda, or purpose.</p>\n<p>Many phantoms have no desire to remain in their strange state of purgatory, either because they seek to continue their journey through the River of Souls or because they fear the corruption of undeath. In order to complete the natural spiritual cycle and become judged so they can continue to the afterlife, a phantom must simply find a way back into the River of Souls.

These monstrous creatures are the most common nindoru and are also the most hated by followers of Sangpotshi, since so many of these fiends rise from fallen members of that very philosophy.</p>\n<p>This type of nindoru relishes the flavor of an oft-reincarnated soul and finds this life force tastes best when consumed while the physical body still lives and screams. To sojiruhs, the sound of a perfect scream from the body it feeds upon is akin to the perfect wine pairing with dinner.</p>\n<p>A sojiruh's mouth is stitched shut with lengths of its own hair. Despite this, they can speak freely, their hollow-sounding voices issuing clearly from sealed lips. They only stretch these stitches when they choose to shriek and scream. Their arms are long and broken-looking, while their chests are little more than rib cages filled with red wet butterflies that crawl through and cling to the creature's ribs and organs. When a sojiruh screams, the wings of the butterflies in its chest flutter frantically.</p>\n<p>Sojiruhs symbolize the cycle of reincarnation come undone from its purity and becoming mired in decay and corruption.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When an evil mortal soul that has been reincarnated multiple times is wrenched from the cycle of souls and corrupted, it can undergo a horrific transformation into a fiend known as a nindoru. A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.</p>\n<p>Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.</p>\n<p>Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane.</p>\n<h2>Reincarnated Souls</h2>\n<p>In some cases, you'll know if a creature a nindoru attacks has a reincarnated soul. Ancestries like samsarans are always reincarnated souls, and a PC's backstory or even their background can often indicate the presence of a previous life. All of the PCs in Season of Ghosts qualify as reincarnated souls, as they've relived their lives over and over for decades. If you ever need to determine if a creature's soul is reincarnated for the purpose of adjudicating a nindoru's ability, attempt a @Check[flat|dc:11]—on a success, it has a reincarnated soul.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Demigods</h2>\n<p>The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as \"nindoru ascetics.\"</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Traitors</h2>\n<p>While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these \"traitors\" are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Butterflies</h2>\n<p>One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air.</p>\n<h2>Other Nindorus</h2>\n<p>Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse-copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus).</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #197: Let the Leaves Fall"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":11,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":8},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":11},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":13}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":11},"athletics":{"base":11},"intimidation":{"base":11},"occultism":{"base":10},"religion":{"base":9}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["chaotic","evil","fiend","nindoru","unholy"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.season-of-ghosts-bestiary.Actor.TVi4RDeqw7GDsxp0"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"U0yn2XcgMw4bPU5B","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","items":[{"_id":"INrRbMnpo1Ydq3Ap","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Flare Up","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p>The warding bell's light increases from a faint flickering to luminous enough that the whole room is brightly lit.

Less common than their smaller cousins, they typically live in areas that support a number of megafauna species. While imposing and certainly dangerous when provoked, even giant vultures are not hostile by nature, preferring to feast on the kills of others.

This type of nindoru looks like a bloated frog with long, slender human arms instead of front feet. Its eyes appear bulbous and blind yet are capable of sight. A guhdggi always carries a large wicker cage strapped to their back, while dozens of cords and straps affix a trove of broken weapons, tools, and items to their belly and flanks. When they walk, they do so with the aid of two long spears clutched in their forearms, stumbling and hopping in an ungainly gait. The most unsettling feature of the guhdggi is its second face, revealed when the frog-like mouth opens to reveal a human face peering from its throat amid a tangled nest of butterflies. This face has long, dark, animated hair capable of inflicting painful lashes, the lengths of which hang from the corner of the frog's mouth when its lips are closed.</p>\n<p>While the guhdggi is no longer capable of movement as swift as most humanoids walk, they still enjoy traveling while harboring a ferocious jealousy of those who can do so with greater ease. One would do well not to underestimate the stumbling stagger of a guhdggi, though! The fiend particularly delights in lying in wait along isolated sections of pilgrimage routes to ambush travelers, trapping victims in their cages and feeding upon their captive's mind and memories of previously visited places.</p>\n<p>Guhdggis embody the cycles of repeated journeys and the concept that every journey taken ends at the start of the next. Central to this concept is the notion that no journey ever truly begins or ends—they just emerge from the previous one.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When an evil mortal soul that has been reincarnated multiple times is wrenched from the cycle of souls and corrupted, it can undergo a horrific transformation into a fiend known as a nindoru. A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.</p>\n<p>Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.</p>\n<p>Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane.</p>\n<h2>Reincarnated Souls</h2>\n<p>In some cases, you'll know if a creature a nindoru attacks has a reincarnated soul. Ancestries like samsarans are always reincarnated souls, and a PC's backstory or even their background can often indicate the presence of a previous life. All of the PCs in Season of Ghosts qualify as reincarnated souls, as they've relived their lives over and over for decades. If you ever need to determine if a creature's soul is reincarnated for the purpose of adjudicating a nindoru's ability, attempt a @Check[flat|dc:11]—on a success, it has a reincarnated soul.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Demigods</h2>\n<p>The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as \"nindoru ascetics.\"</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Traitors</h2>\n<p>While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these \"traitors\" are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Butterflies</h2>\n<p>One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air.</p>\n<h2>Other Nindorus</h2>\n<p>Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse-copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus).</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #197: Let the Leaves Fall"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":14,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":13},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":14}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":11},"athletics":{"base":13},"intimidation":{"base":11},"occultism":{"base":11},"religion":{"base":12},"stealth":{"base":11},"survival":{"base":14}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["chaotic","evil","fiend","nindoru","unholy"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.season-of-ghosts-bestiary.Actor.Z97fXdQ6kTe7PUIr"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"zas6jyBtcVQUaNl0","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","items":[{"_id":"PAQVR3xsJQOf323b","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Cyclone of Hair","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature attempts to interact with or speak to the haunt</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The ghostly woman shrieks and rises into the air as her hair grows swiftly, snaking through the shop to tangle into the rafters or weave through the seating area.

Most noppera-bos don't recall their origins, and are often more interested in pretending to be someone else entirely.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #196: The Summer That Never Was"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"no face","mod":8,"senses":[]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":6},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":8}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":7},"athletics":{"base":5},"crafting":{"base":7},"deception":{"base":9},"occultism":{"base":7},"stealth":{"base":7}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["aberration","chaotic","evil"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.season-of-ghosts-bestiary.Actor.zhw2TOrXkWyvle5S"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"zpZYEywWXAeI55iS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","items":[{"_id":"MBsjaNDjPo7EUPuW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Grasping Hands","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Goh steps into the Ceiba River</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> A shadowy figure that looks like a swimming child appears to grab ahold of Goh's ankles and begins to pull him deeper into the water; Goh becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}.
