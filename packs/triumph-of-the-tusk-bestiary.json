This spite might come from their own malevolent will in life, or can be instilled by necromantic rituals, typically involving the desecration of burial sites. Wights usually haunt burial grounds, catacombs, or other places of the dead. Their hunger is targeted toward the living—those whose pumping hearts and ruddy warmth inspire visceral hatred.</p>\n<p>As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for different wights with different niches to fill. The environment, too, plays a part in determining a wight's special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instance, can be found in parts of the world where exposure is a common end and the resentment of being left alone in the wild is a common source of spite. Durable and sustained by void energy, wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the way some lesser undead do.</p>\n<p>A single wight can wreak significant havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb. Because creatures slain under a wight's curse can become wights as well, all it takes is a single wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde of these undead. Thus, canny priests and adventurers know that the best solution to a wight problem is swift and total eradication. Care must be taken, though, to destroy wight spawn before attempting to destroy the parent wight, for spawn without a master gain the ability to create spawn of their own.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder #208: Hoof, Cinder, and Storm"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":13,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":14},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":11}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":12},"intimidation":{"base":12},"stealth":{"base":11}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["undead","unholy","wight"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.triumph-of-the-tusk-bestiary.Actor.6kkf6KKqdepx7PSD"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"6UMoTRikLYkJiOj9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","items":[{"_id":"bXnYmJKHiYtCIfgQ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Cries of War","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Two or more creatures enter the haunt's area</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> Each creature sees the forms of nearby allies shift and fade, replaced with hostile One Eye orcs.

Belkzen doesn't have rich soil or abundant deposits of valuable metals and minerals. Instead, orc crafters rely on salvage from battles or trade with outsiders for their raw materials.

They rely on their incredible strength to overpower foes with their vicious claws and toothy maws. These trolls stand anywhere from 12 to 16 feet tall, though they prefer to hunch for comfort and to lull foes into a false sense of security. Trolls are truly creatures of the forest, deeply linked in flesh and blood to the verdant habitats they consider their territory. In fact, when a forest troll is killed, their flesh turns into blackened lumps of charcoal, often still glowing with coals. Despite that, these creatures roam farther and wider than most of their kin, to the extent that they're the first creatures a common person thinks of when they hear the word \"troll.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Slavering, cruel, invincible brutes: this is the villager's stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. The roots of these stories are undoubtedly true. Trolls' flesh endlessly regrows, going so far as to sprout aberrant limbs or additional heads if not pruned, and a bottomless hunger is required to feed such unfettered growth. Even in the process of glutting themselves, however, trolls find opportunities to taunt their prey and inflict petty cruelties.</p>\n<p>A troll's ability to survive is so strong that they believe even the smallest scrap of flesh will slowly regenerate into a new form, suffering as all the powers of the land are gathered to revive them. Despite the pain, trolls speak of this unassailable vitality as a blessing from their creator. Few trolls have heard the laughter of demons who claim that creator cursed the trolls and cast them down from lofty heights, binding them so they could never rise again.</p>\n<p>Trolls prefer to remain solitary, keeping every scrap of food for themselves. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead groups of trolls. Such warleaders possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. This link to their environment is an often misunderstood aspect of trollkind, and grows more acute with a troll's age and power. That's not to say trolls are valorous protectors of nature. They're vicious and territorial, and will blight their own territory forever if it means more to eat for a day.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder #208: Hoof, Cinder, and Storm"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":11,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":17},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":11},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":7}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":12},"intimidation":{"base":12}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["giant","humanoid","troll","wood"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.triumph-of-the-tusk-bestiary.Actor.iFCh60rD3GIZ6Dva"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"igzD3pYQ0MEHP3zs","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"Pcw3uDTBL6s6FXhV","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":20,"value":12},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"lCKtkKqa2WHKMplT","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.VosLNn2M8S7JH67D"},"img":"icons/skills/wounds/injury-eyes-blood-red.webp","name":"Blindness","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"fortitude"}},"description":{"value":"<p>You blind the target.

Many are faithful followers of recently fallen gods. Though their deity has been cast down, an orc doomsayer's unwavering faith allows them to hold onto a sliver of their god's essence to power their abilities.</p><hr /><p>The orcs of Belkzen are survivors to the core. Shaped by the unforgiving landscape, they're experts at managing resources and making do with scarcity. Aside from the relative peace from late spring through early summer during the Flood Truce, Belkzen's orc holds are nearly always at odds with each other, though these conflicts rarely rise to the level of war. Instead, there are raids for supplies, skirmishes to establish borders or retake lost territory, and feuds over personal slights. Outsiders who travel in Belkzen often become embroiled in these conflicts; sometimes they even trigger the fights themselves.</p>\n<p>The members of a given hold are often quite spread out, rather than centralized, so communication and coordination is sporadic. Even the Empty Hand orcs of Urgir rarely stay in the city all year long. At the very least, they travel a few miles to the Flood Road when the aurochs arrive, and they may wander even further afield when the mood strikes.</p><h2>Orc Faith</h2><p>With so many sudden disruptions to the orc pantheon, the faithful find themselves in a confusing time of change. Fervent worshippers of Lanishra, Sezelrian, and Zagresh don't particularly like the new deities who have usurped their old gods. Some of these zealots desperately cling to their old faiths, and many still hold a sliver of their fallen deity's power, further adding to the confusion.</p><h2>Salvage</h2><p>Orcs are experts at repurposing materials for their own use. Belkzen doesn't have rich soil or abundant deposits of valuable metals and minerals. Instead, orc crafters rely on salvage from battles or trade with outsiders for their raw materials. It's common for a basic tool, such as a knife or cooking pot, to be very old yet kept in perfect working condition. Even when a tool breaks, orc crafters find ways to reuse as much of it as they can manage.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder #207: The Resurrection Flood"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":14,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":12},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":15}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":11},"deception":{"base":12},"intimidation":{"base":12},"medicine":{"base":12},"religion":{"base":13}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["humanoid","orc"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.triumph-of-the-tusk-bestiary.Actor.IHtnqHDC2rlfnv0n"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"j86Opjp9z2cDKSNA","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"q7A3h6Ii3HofYu0H","img":"icons/weapons/axes/axe-broad-black.webp","name":"Hatchet","sort":100000,"system":{"baseItem":"hatchet","bonus":{"value":0},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"bulk":{"value":0.1},"category":"martial","containerId":null,"damage":{"damageType":"slashing","dice":1,"die":"d6"},"description":{"value":"<p>This small axe can be used in close combat or thrown.</p>"},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","handsHeld":0,"invested":null},"group":"axe","hardness":0,"hp":{"max":0,"value":0},"level":{"value":0},"material":{"grade":null,"type":null},"price":{"value":{"sp":4}},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"quantity":1,"range":null,"reload":{"value":"-"},"rules":[],"runes":{"potency":0,"property":[],"striking":0},"size":"med","slug":"hatchet","splashDamage":{"value":0},"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["agile","sweep","thrown-10"]},"usage":{"canBeAmmo":false,"value":"held-in-one-hand"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"weapon","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"iAU6JTOMo0uu53pK","img":"icons/equipment/chest/shirt-collared-pink.webp","name":"Explorer's Clothing","sort":200000,"system":{"acBonus":0,"baseItem":"explorers-clothing","bulk":{"value":0.1},"category":"unarmored","checkPenalty":0,"containerId":null,"description":{"value":"<p>Adventurers who don't wear armor travel in durable clothing.

Some live as bandit leaders, assembling their own group of veterans and outcasts. Many others work as the elite guards of their hold, keeping a watchful eye out for trouble.</p><hr /><p>The orcs of Belkzen are survivors to the core. Shaped by the unforgiving landscape, they're experts at managing resources and making do with scarcity. Aside from the relative peace from late spring through early summer during the Flood Truce, Belkzen's orc holds are nearly always at odds with each other, though these conflicts rarely rise to the level of war. Instead, there are raids for supplies, skirmishes to establish borders or retake lost territory, and feuds over personal slights. Outsiders who travel in Belkzen often become embroiled in these conflicts; sometimes they even trigger the fights themselves.</p>\n<p>The members of a given hold are often quite spread out, rather than centralized, so communication and coordination is sporadic. Even the Empty Hand orcs of Urgir rarely stay in the city all year long. At the very least, they travel a few miles to the Flood Road when the aurochs arrive, and they may wander even further afield when the mood strikes.</p><h2>Orc Faith</h2><p>With so many sudden disruptions to the orc pantheon, the faithful find themselves in a confusing time of change. Fervent worshippers of Lanishra, Sezelrian, and Zagresh don't particularly like the new deities who have usurped their old gods. Some of these zealots desperately cling to their old faiths, and many still hold a sliver of their fallen deity's power, further adding to the confusion.</p><h2>Salvage</h2><p>Orcs are experts at repurposing materials for their own use. Belkzen doesn't have rich soil or abundant deposits of valuable metals and minerals. Instead, orc crafters rely on salvage from battles or trade with outsiders for their raw materials. It's common for a basic tool, such as a knife or cooking pot, to be very old yet kept in perfect working condition. Even when a tool breaks, orc crafters find ways to reuse as much of it as they can manage.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder #207: The Resurrection Flood"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":9,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":11},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":10},"intimidation":{"base":7},"stealth":{"base":9}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["humanoid","orc"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.triumph-of-the-tusk-bestiary.Actor.nqWKcbMnyIpvtf4T"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"nz0wC5rfBf8tfPCr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","items":[{"_id":"Z8QGOt12y8Ba5QeA","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Calcium Consumption","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature with bones touches the mold or steps into an area covered with it</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The mold shudders and slithers onto the triggering creature as it attempts to absorb calcium through their skin.

Bristle boars are all three. Many orcs admire the bristle boar, viewing them as living symbols of the toughness Belkzen demands from its inhabitants. With their spiny manes, sharp tusks, keen noses, and irascible nature, the creatures are both intimidating and dangerous.</p>\n<p>Hunters throughout the Inner Sea region know that taking down a wild boar can prove deadly for the unprepared. Bristle boars—the name given to both male and female specimen—are even more challenging to kill. Further, their meat is sinewy, so few hunters even bother with the animals. For those who fell the beasts, the boars' spined hides often serve as trophies of the hunter's skill.</p>\n<p>Bristle boars are not as reliant on the Deluge as other animals in Belkzen. Though they're certainly found in the green areas that spring up during the annual flooding, sounders of bristle boars can survive even in desolate areas like the Dirt Sea, grubbing for sustenance where few others can. The Cleft Head Hold maintains a small herd of tamed bristle boars.</p>\n<p>The orcs have learned that, with the right trainer, the clever animals make excellent companions. Aside from their utility in battle, the boars are often used to sniff out the rare yellow truffles that grow throughout the hold.</p>\n<p>A typical bristle boar stands 4 feet tall and weighs roughly 200 pounds.</p><h2>Stuck Treasure</h2><p>Although they don't seek out shiny objects like some animals, bristle boars who evade hunters often escape with weapons embedded in their thick hides. The Empty Hand orcs tell of a famous bristle boar dubbed \"Silverspear\" after the silvery spear stuck in its hide. Stories claim the boar's spear is imbued with powerful magic, and while many warriors have hunted Silverspear to claim its weapon, so far none have

During winter, vast herds of the animals roam the southern reaches of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, but as the ice high in the mountains begins to melt, the aurochs migrate south into Belkzen, following their ancestral route along the Flood Road. Once the water flows in earnest and turns to massive floods, the sudden surge of greenery provides the aurochs with all the food they need to survive.</p>\n<p>Aurochs are essential to life in Belkzen. Not only do the orcs there hunt the wild cattle for their meat, but they use every part of the aurochs, from hide to bones, to craft their weapons and tools. The aurochs' arrival prompts the beginning of the Flood Truce, during which the usually war-focused orc holds cease all hostilities to take advantage of this time of plenty.</p>\n<p>While groups of 20 or fewer animals are sometimes encountered, most aurochs travel in herds that stretch to the horizon. The land thunders under the weight of these herds, and the dust kicked up by their hooves is often spotted days before the aurochs—or the floodwaters that spurred their migration—arrive.</p>\n<p>Aurochs bulls stand between 6 and 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh around 2,500 pounds, although prodigious specimens can grow to over 7 feet tall and 3,000 pounds. Cows are smaller, standing near 6 feet at the shoulder and weighing up to 2,000 pounds. All aurochs have slightly curved horns that grow up to three feet long from base to spear-sharp tip.</p>\n<p>The aurochs is represented in much of Belkzen's artwork. Not only are the animals vital to survival in that unforgiving land, but their strength, power, and tenacity serve as potent symbols for orc holds.</p><h2>Aurochs Rolling</h2><p>Farmers throughout the Inner Sea often joke about cow tipping: sneaking up on an unsuspecting bovine and pushing it over while it sleeps. But since cattle sleep lying down, the animal usually has the last laugh. Nonetheless, some younger orcs in Belkzen spend evenings creeping up on sleeping aurochs to roll them over.
