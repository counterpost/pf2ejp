In their natural form, these graceful eight-legged creatures sport a gray tabby coat of fur streaked with lines of olive green, but they are rarely seen this way. Even the youngest porachas are capable of hiding within objects, making them incredibly elusive and rarely seen except on their own terms. Because porachas can so effortlessly blend in with the forest and emerge from its dark corners in an instant, superstitious locals believe these beasts are related to kami—nature spirits who embody individual trees, stones, or other elements of nature in the Forest of Spirits. The truth is, while porachas frequently associate with kami, they are their own breed of monster.</p>\n<p>The poracha's most iconic feature is its ability to bend reality to teleport, or jaunt, short distances. But a poracha can also rest within objects, allowing it to safely sleep inside. Given that a poracha experiences time very slowly while hiding within objects, it can sleep inside one for an extended period. Once it wakes, a poracha departs to play in the living world.</p>\n<p>Porachas especially enjoy resting inside roadside milestones, to maximize their chances of coming across travelers. Porachas rarely tread humanoid-occupied lands, preferring the company of the kami and their natural habitat in the Forest of Spirits. Though they enjoy occasional conversation, they're extremely sensitive to sound; they speak softly and request the same from those they speak with. Their territories span vast swaths of the wood, making them ideal allies for hunters or treasure seekers who would otherwise become lost in the dense trees. But porachas are nothing if not fickle, and typically demand inscrutable favors in return for their aid, such as the planting of a rare sapling or the clearing of an invasive monster species. Any attempt to coerce or trick a poracha into service is ill advised, for these sacred beasts have many friends among the kami as well as others of their kind. Though they generally don't travel in groups, porachas know where to find more of their kind in times of need, and an organized pack of porachas is a disorienting threat.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-02: Rain Falls on the Mountain of Sea and Sky"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":6,"senses":[{"acuity":"imprecise","range":10,"type":"tremorsense"},{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":5},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":8},"athletics":{"base":5},"deception":{"base":6},"diplomacy":{"base":6},"stealth":{"base":8},"survival":{"base":6}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["beast"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-6-bestiary.Actor.0fQp2UdHBSzo3LuU"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"0mZd8HUWC8Gym9Kb","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","items":[{"_id":"rxOsziyGjAqRLubw","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Bloodthirsty Wails","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A living creature comes within 30 feet of the haunt</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The haunt wails, cursing the living for allowing the Puddles residents to wallow in misery while Absalom's elites prosper.

Unlike petitioners, these ethereal phantoms retain memories of their life before death, and unlike spirits such as ghosts, phantoms aren't tinged with the foul influences of undeath—at least, not at first, though the threat of corruption hangs heavy over a phantom's existence.

In order to complete the natural spiritual cycle and become judged so they can continue to the afterlife, a phantom must find a way back into the River of Souls.

The concept of gender is fluid to a succubus, as they can adopt countless humanoid forms of any gender to aid in their goals. Most succubi have a feminine true form (incubi, which usually have a masculine true form, are a different kind of demon), but regardless of gender, a lust demon is supernaturally beautiful or handsome, but with curving horns, bat wings, sharp claws, and a sinuous tail.</p>\n<p>When disguised as a mortal humanoid in the Universe, a succubus whispers into the ears of mortals, urging them to pursue their darkest and most destructive desires and pushing them into depravity, using magic only if persuasion fails. While mortals often fixate on succubi's application of sexual lust, these demons are can easily exploit lust for power, knowledge, fame, or any other desire as easily as more carnal appetites. Their ability to infiltrate societies makes them excellent spies, assassins, and political saboteurs as well. Ultimately, the succubus enjoys all means of upending mortal culture.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Outer Rifts, it can become a deadly fiend—a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin—be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more \"specialized\" depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold—the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Outer Rifts.</p>\n<p>Demons are selfish and self-absorbed creatures, and most firmly believe that mortals only play at being more virtuous than fiends. They enjoy tempting mortals into damnation to both indulge their egos and swell their armies. Like many other fiends, one of the great rewards of this manipulation is fulfilling their hunger for souls. In their eyes, the primary use for these souls is to spawn new demons, who can serve as soldiers, slaves, pawns, or even currency for their more powerful masters.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-00: Salt of the Ocean"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":15,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":15},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":14},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":17}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":14},"deception":{"base":18},"diplomacy":{"base":20},"intimidation":{"base":16},"religion":{"base":13},"society":{"base":15},"stealth":{"base":14}},"spellcasting":{"rituals":{"dc":26}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["demon","fiend","unholy"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-6-bestiary.Actor.BbhEPZ59tIuwXZD6"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"bzqzQUuyTDIqV6Lv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","items":[{"_id":"xPnrOJTbYFs7zovH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Athame","sort":0,"system":{"attackEffects":{"value":[]},"bonus":{"value":12},"damageRolls":{"H0O5eXMMtHhvUY2G":{"damage":"1d6","damageType":"piercing"},"UppxwDEzdVhdbhhT":{"category":"persistent","damage":"1d6","damageType":"bleed"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"93fXOGYchR42JY5W","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","name":"Blood Sacrifice","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Sailing Mission 5 begins;</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The trap makes an athame Strike against a random creature, and then rolls initiative.</p>"},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[{"key":"Immunity","mode":"remove","type":"object-immunities"}],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]}],"name":"Sailor's Warning (3-4)","prototypeToken":{"name":"Sailor's Warning"},"system":{"attributes":{"ac":{"value":0},"emitsSound":"encounter","hardness":0,"hp":{"details":"","max":0,"temp":0,"value":0},"stealth":{"details":"<p>(trained)</p>","value":10}},"details":{"description":"<p>An illusory cyclops in oracular robes cries out a warning, but then dissolves into a violent phantasmal cyclops, which calls out for the Blind Formless Chaos That Lies Behind the Stars to accept his sacrifice.

While smaller than most drakes, river drakes are more than capable of plaguing river travelers and are equally at home above and below the water's surface. This flexibility allows them to catch a wide variety of prey, from fish and boggards to deer and the occasional ferry passenger.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ravenous, bestial, and driven by instinct, drakes are draconic monsters who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of the primal dragons they share evolutionary roots with. While they're weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups fittingly called \"rampages\"—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.</p>\n<p>Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them with their formidable jaws and thickscaled tails to use in close combat. Most drakes would rather avoid this, however, preferring to use their magical breath to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.</p>\n<p>Different species of drakes rarely come into conflict. Part of this is their distinct habitats, but drakes are open to negotiating simple agreements between rampages. This courtesy does not extend to dragonets, which drakes happily take as prey. Solitary tamed drakes are also excluded from such agreements and considered free game if their tamer isn't strong enough to protect them.</p>\n<h3>Drake Eggs</h3>\n<p>While drake hides aren't any more valuable than those of similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. They are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, but the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.</p>\n<p>A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.</p>\n<p>A drake egg is an object with Hardness 3, 5 HP, and no Broken Threshold. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a @Check[nature|dc:20] check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.</p>\n<p>Once a drake hatches, they imprint on the first creature that they see.

This sea insect swims with a grace that is just as majestic as it is unnerving. The con rit is dark brown on its dorsal side and sickly yellow on its ventral surface. This makes it much more difficult to spot, whether looking from above or below. Its exoskeleton is as hard as iron, and the shifting of its plates makes an elongated, eerie ringing sound as it swims.</p>\n<p>Many once thought the con rit to be a dragon of some kind. This was due not only to its massive size but also to its ability to launch its venom in a concentrated blast. It would use this technique to shoot birds out of the sky or knock sailors off ships. Their movement through the water is also not entirely dissimilar to that of dragons. Those who seek out a con rit's lair in search of treasure are usually disappointed (when they aren't eaten alive by the huge insect).</p>\n<p>There are legends that a con rit, much like a phoenix, is reborn after its death. This, however, is not the case. A con rit will make a nest far below the surface of its territory, usually in underwater caves. Throughout its life, a con rit will lay thousands of eggs in its cave that will never hatch. The con rit will eat any egg that gets too old, but there are always large numbers of them remaining. When a con rit dies, it releases a strong-smelling chemical into the air and water that triggers the hatching process. The eggs will slowly crack open within the month, and hundreds of baby con rits will begin to fight each other for territory. By year's end, one will win and reach full maturity. This cycle is what has led to the legends of endless rebirth. Other stories say that every generation of the con rit is ever so slightly smaller, leading to tales of ancient con rits that were hundreds of feet long. However, the size of such legendary insects has yet to be confirmed by scholars who study such things.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-00: Salt of the Ocean"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":13,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":15},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":12},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":8}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":11,"special":[]},"athletics":{"base":16,"special":[]},"stealth":{"base":11,"special":[]}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["animal","aquatic"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-6-bestiary.Actor.ERU2OJ2i7lgfTmrt"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"eWVvyriH1S9HFIH0","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"m9dIszotbO8vukOI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Primal Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":24,"value":16},"tradition":{"value":"primal"},"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"lgDxJmtHFjvOF0sM","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.J6vNvrUT3b1hx2iA"},"img":"icons/magic/nature/root-vines-grow-brown.webp","name":"Entangling Flora","sort":200000,"system":{"area":{"details":"all squares in a 20-foot-radius burst that contain plants","type":"burst","value":20},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"reflex"}},"description":{"value":"<p>Plants and fungi burst out or quickly grow, entangling creatures.

When a crafter first begins to study the art of creating constructs, they often craft a homunculus first, since the creation process is simple and inexpensive due to a magical shortcut: the use of the creator's own blood. This forges a link between the homunculus and its master, causing the homunculus to gain a spark of the creator's intellect, as well as the same moral values and some of the creator's basic personality traits. Homunculi left to their own devices never stray far from their masters.</p>\n<p>In most cases, a homunculus doesn't survive the death of its master for long. Deprived of its creator, a homunculus loses focus and grows increasingly selfdestructive, and some even end up battering themselves to annihilation. Rarely, a homunculus with a slain master survives the trauma with its mind intact, often seeing itself as its deceased creator's child or successor and attempting to further its creator's legacy as best it can. In such cases, and if the homunculus was in close proximity to its master upon that creature's death, a portion of the dead master's soul \"infects\" the surviving homunculus as they pass on to the afterlife.</p>\n<p>This doesn't result in a truly soulbound homunculus, since only a fragment of the soul is left behind, but this is still enough to grant the homunculus a greater personality, free will of its own, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to speak. Over time, a few of these \"awakened\" homunculi even go so far as to become convinced that they are the reincarnation of their prior masters, although their actual personalities never quite reach the depth and complexity of a truly living creature. They are, at best, caricatures of the master, and at worst, they become awful, bitter-minded parodies of life itself. Still, a free-willed homunculus might pursue studies in its creator's class, becoming a unique creature with the abilities of that class if time and fortune permit.</p>\n<p>Homunculi are created from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water, and a pint of the creator's own blood.

Whether as a result of nefarious interlopers like daemons or hags, malignant planar magic, or even fate, these souls become dislodged from the natural order of life and death and linger in a sort of purgatory. Unlike petitioners, these ethereal phantoms retain memories of their life before death, and unlike spirits such as ghosts, phantoms aren't tinged with the foul influences of undeath—at least, not at first, though the threat of corruption hangs heavy over a phantom's existence. Some eventually succumb to that fate, while others eventually rejoin the River of Souls.

In order to complete the natural spiritual cycle and become judged so they can continue to the afterlife, a phantom must find a way back into the River of Souls. Such a quest is no easy feat, however—the hazy mists of the Ethereal Plane can befuddle even the most experienced traveler, and numerous predators prowl the realm in search of stray souls to bind or devour.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-04: An Enkindled Carnival"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"darkvision","mod":16,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":11},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":15},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":16}},"skills":{"intimidation":{"base":15}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["ethereal","incorporeal","phantom","spirit"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-6-bestiary.Actor.ooCLBFbCLCQWhPqD"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"p6ScuVpuqhDJxNie","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"dA9ja4nE5mwYhHh5","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/weapons/specific-magic-weapons/bloodletting-kukri.webp","name":"Bloodletting Kukri","sort":100000,"system":{"baseItem":"kukri","bonus":{"value":1},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"bulk":{"value":0.1},"category":"martial","containerId":null,"damage":{"damageType":"slashing","dice":1,"die":"d6"},"description":{"value":"<p>This <em>+1 striking kukri</em> has a crimson blade that shimmers eerily in bright light.

While smaller than most drakes, river drakes are more than capable of plaguing river travelers and are equally at home above and below the water's surface. This flexibility allows them to catch a wide variety of prey, from fish and boggards to deer and the occasional ferry passenger.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ravenous, bestial, and driven by instinct, drakes are draconic monsters who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of the primal dragons they share evolutionary roots with. While they're weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups fittingly called \"rampages\"—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.</p>\n<p>Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them with their formidable jaws and thickscaled tails to use in close combat. Most drakes would rather avoid this, however, preferring to use their magical breath to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.</p>\n<p>Different species of drakes rarely come into conflict. Part of this is their distinct habitats, but drakes are open to negotiating simple agreements between rampages. This courtesy does not extend to dragonets, which drakes happily take as prey. Solitary tamed drakes are also excluded from such agreements and considered free game if their tamer isn't strong enough to protect them.</p>\n<h3>Drake Eggs</h3>\n<p>While drake hides aren't any more valuable than those of similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. They are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, but the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.</p>\n<p>A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.</p>\n<p>A drake egg is an object with Hardness 3, 5 HP, and no Broken Threshold. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a @Check[nature|dc:20] check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.</p>\n<p>Once a drake hatches, they imprint on the first creature that they see. A creature imprinted on in this way can use Nature to Train and Command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the type of drake and the exact legal situation. Because drakes are dangerous and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.</p>\n<p>It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-00: Salt of the Ocean"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":12,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":30,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":14},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":12},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":10}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":14,"special":[]},"athletics":{"base":13,"special":[]},"intimidation":{"base":9,"special":[]},"stealth":{"base":12,"special":[]},"survival":{"base":10,"special":[]}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["amphibious","dragon","unholy","water"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-6-bestiary.Actor.vcFcMU2RSaYdnbo0"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"VG1sSOR0MB0vZmWg","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"gOiaDjo5WK8ESJHN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":16,"mod":0,"value":8},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"kXNpZJNwP0OyD0ds","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.WsUwpfmhKrKwoIe3"},"img":"icons/magic/time/hourglass-tilted-gray.webp","name":"Slow","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"fortitude"}},"description":{"value":"<p>You dilate the flow of time around the target, slowing its actions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2} for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> You can target up to 10 creatures.</p>"},"duration":{"sustained":false,"value":"1 minute"},"heightening":{"levels":{"6":{"target":{"value":"10 creatures"}}},"type":"fixed"},"level":{"value":3},"location":{"heightenedLevel":3,"value":"gOiaDjo5WK8ESJHN"},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"range":{"value":"30 feet"},"requirements":"","rules":[],"slug":"slow","target":{"value":"1 creature"},"time":{"value":"2"},"traits":{"rarity":"common","traditions":["arcane","occult","primal"],"value":["concentrate","manipulate"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spell","effects":[]},{"_id":"JMVuOemee69jwYP3","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.tsKnoBuBbKMXkiz5"},"img":"icons/sundries/scrolls/scroll-writing-tan-grey.webp","name":"Demonic Pact","sort":300000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You call in a favor from one demon of level 2 or lower, two demons of level 0 or lower, or three demons of level –1 or lower.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You conjure the demon or demons.

While smaller than most drakes, river drakes are more than capable of plaguing river travelers and are equally at home above and below the water's surface. This flexibility allows them to catch a wide variety of prey, from fish and boggards to deer and the occasional ferry passenger.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ravenous, bestial, and driven by instinct, drakes are draconic monsters who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of the primal dragons they share evolutionary roots with. While they're weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups fittingly called \"rampages\"—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.</p>\n<p>Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them with their formidable jaws and thickscaled tails to use in close combat. Most drakes would rather avoid this, however, preferring to use their magical breath to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.</p>\n<p>Different species of drakes rarely come into conflict. Part of this is their distinct habitats, but drakes are open to negotiating simple agreements between rampages. This courtesy does not extend to dragonets, which drakes happily take as prey. Solitary tamed drakes are also excluded from such agreements and considered free game if their tamer isn't strong enough to protect them.</p>\n<h3>Drake Eggs</h3>\n<p>While drake hides aren't any more valuable than those of similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. They are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, but the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.</p>\n<p>A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.</p>\n<p>A drake egg is an object with Hardness 3, 5 HP, and no Broken Threshold. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a @Check[nature|dc:20] check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.</p>\n<p>Once a drake hatches, they imprint on the first creature that they see. A creature imprinted on in this way can use Nature to Train and Command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the type of drake and the exact legal situation. Because drakes are dangerous and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.</p>\n<p>It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-05: Silver Bark, Golden Blades"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":14,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":30,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":14},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":12},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":10}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":14},"athletics":{"base":13},"intimidation":{"base":9},"stealth":{"base":12},"survival":{"base":10}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["amphibious","dragon","water"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-6-bestiary.Actor.wcgXXXDuc8RzUl3P"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"WFzFnVT4p0o3Pl4O","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"dA9ja4nE5mwYhHh5","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/weapons/specific-magic-weapons/bloodletting-kukri.webp","name":"Bloodletting Kukri","sort":100000,"system":{"baseItem":"kukri","bonus":{"value":1},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"bulk":{"value":0.1},"category":"martial","containerId":null,"damage":{"damageType":"slashing","dice":1,"die":"d6"},"description":{"value":"<p>This <em>+1 striking kukri</em> has a crimson blade that shimmers eerily in bright light.

Stories of ogre gluttons being tricked into eating razor-edged shields or barrels filled with poisoned meat are common, but such tales are of little consolation to those who have been gobbled whole by these ravenous giants. In addition to their sadistic table manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming up with violent \"games\" that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those who somehow manage to beat a glutton at the rules of their own game can often enrage the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum provides an opportunity for the captives to escape.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For many societies, ogres embody brutish, amoral violence and greedy cruelty. Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are usually as strong as they are vicious. The worst ogres are sadists, enjoying remorseless murder, torture, and violence in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on other humanoids—the smaller the better—ogre captivity can end in a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp: becoming dinner. But for all their creativity in inflicting pain, ogres often forget that their playthings lack their own robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, and many of their captives die sooner than the ogres might prefer. Meanwhile, those who manage to survive captivity in an ogre's larder often emerge with lasting mental scars. A captive able to keep their wits about them, however, can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, more plentiful food sources, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre's often-limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape or gain revenge.</p>\n<p>Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. The most powerful ogre in any family is the \"boss\"—usually the family's patriarch or matriarch—whom the other ogres in the family learn to quickly obey or risk being brutalized by the boss's loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy. Their lairs are filthy and frequently contain all-too-recognizable evidence of their depravity, along with assorted treasures stolen from past captives.</p>","publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-05: Silver Bark, Golden Blades"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":6,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":14},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":12},"intimidate":{"base":10},"intimidation":{"base":10},"survival":{"base":6}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["giant","humanoid","hungerseed"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-6-bestiary.Actor.zPCvmyhQFzAG8xbD"},"effects":[]}]
