For example, cave worms hatched in volcanic environments mature into crimson worms, while those raised near water sources mature into azure worms. Regardless of their environment, larval cave worms all have translucent bodies and pallid carapaces that harden and change color as they mature. When a brood of cave worms hatches from their eggs, the foot-long worms mass together, forming a swarm of ravenous larval worms. This swarm travels ceaselessly, consuming anything in its path. The young are drawn to movement, as living, squirming prey tends to be the most nutritious. As they age, they incorporate more minerals into their diet to support carapace growth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #195: Heavy is the Crown"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":14,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":100,"type":"tremorsense"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":21},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":19},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":12}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":22}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["animal","swarm"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.sky-kings-tomb-bestiary.Actor.AzNWXvFzhPDpSyYL"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"B4292QvNu2lKOyFU","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"3tCS3ZHyZN6cbWaZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Prepared Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"prepared"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slots":{"slot0":{"max":4,"prepared":[{"id":"LAsvFLlVqG8Q6vGH"},{"id":"6Okmi2GrGnWeBFek"},{"id":"4D57gojSXEJ9vEuA"},{"id":"4kBhATZe9Ilu6XwH"}]},"slot1":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"vdkQR5wCA38sTyeX"},{"id":"2gV5cNayVwU7VD5t"},{"id":"2gV5cNayVwU7VD5t"}]},"slot2":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"PT6ic7ksMxrDD7ul"},{"id":"GXwP6Fkemn72uKAK"},{"id":"7IvuKV1CXDKVMg0E"}]},"slot3":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"ROsCl0KGm2k6uHgN"},{"id":"uqsTdiryML1f5lLC"},{"id":"yPJcoiSHq7q32s7i"}]},"slot4":{"max":2,"prepared":[{"id":"MoMgBkTIoZvjPjl7"},{"id":"STWl6H7zxZmTtu4X"}]}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":26,"value":20},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"YtYfRybaXmaVNE11","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":26,"value":20},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"R65uwKCXAHMKmopS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Focus Spells","sort":300000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"focus"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":26,"value":20},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"STWl6H7zxZmTtu4X","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.8M03UxGXjYyDFAoy"},"img":"icons/skills/melee/spear-tips-three-purple.webp","name":"Weapon Storm","sort":400000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"reflex"}},"description":{"value":"<p>You swing a weapon you're holding, and the weapon magically multiplies into duplicates that swipe at all creatures in either a @Template[cone|distance:30] or an @Template[emanation|distance:10].

If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM.

These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia.

These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia.

While on contract, hryngar assassins are on the lookout for new technologies, gadgets, and alchemical creations.

Droskar, Master of the Dark Furnace, teaches them that toiling for their masters, who in turn toil for their masters above, will lead all of them to become stronger than ever.

These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #195: Heavy is the Crown"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":12,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":100,"type":"tremorsense"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":20},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":14},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":10}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":18},"stealth":{"base":14}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["animal"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.sky-kings-tomb-bestiary.Actor.eGNnA8XCvSgEsrkp"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"eqTcqD5Abi2TtOtk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"52vktDQQT5rvw3Ge","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Ghostly Clan Dagger","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"value":[]},"bonus":{"value":8},"damageRolls":{"v1N2HAR57Pz5JJRX":{"damage":"1d6+2","damageType":"void"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":["agile","finesse","magical"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"vkBV3kjtxkjrpwy3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Riled by Disrespect","sort":200000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>An ancestral echo gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throw DCs against any creature that has not performed at least one task to beautify the site to which the echo is bound.

For example, cave worms hatched in volcanic environments mature into crimson worms, while those raised near water sources mature into azure worms. Regardless of their environment, larval cave worms all have translucent bodies and pallid carapaces that harden and change color as they mature. When a brood of cave worms hatches from their eggs, the foot-long worms mass together, forming a swarm of ravenous larval worms. This swarm travels ceaselessly, consuming anything in its path. The young are drawn to movement, as living, squirming prey tends to be the most nutritious. As they age, they incorporate more minerals into their diet to support carapace growth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #195: Heavy is the Crown"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":14,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":100,"type":"tremorsense"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":21},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":19},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":12}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":22}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["animal","swarm"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.sky-kings-tomb-bestiary.Actor.fNmv72cAmZxc6HvN"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"FQwprKNkOjmqYQCO","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"TYB3MYeHB6r61ioi","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"value":[]},"bonus":{"value":19},"damageRolls":{"qJERJjYVjO3Hmkrd":{"damage":"2d12+6","damageType":"piercing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":["magical","reach-10"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"UrTqDEgbc9NHraSP","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tail","sort":200000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"value":[]},"bonus":{"value":19},"damageRolls":{"Zs9sdmQtY0XrDSeM":{"damage":"2d8+6","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"value":["magical","reach-10"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"YTWbuvUPSMPGhU1j","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Construct Armor","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>Like normal objects, a crimson worm statue has Hardness.

and dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams. In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #195: Heavy is the Crown"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":14,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":15},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":18},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":14}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":14},"deception":{"base":18},"intimidation":{"base":18},"occultism":{"base":12},"stealth":{"base":18}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["dream","evil","incorporeal"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.sky-kings-tomb-bestiary.Actor.g7rVihECWjZ7ehDc"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"G7RxS2VvwZDZs0fa","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"RakruKdO5oN5J1ZW","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.OvqohW9YuahnFaiX"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/OneAction.webp","name":"Form Up","sort":100000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":1},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.FormUp]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary 3"},"rules":[],"slug":"form-up","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"sXbsdhvyWSPKHCCv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Stench","sort":200000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>30 feet.

These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5.

They attack from the darkness and at range, and kobold artificers and engineers master the art of simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs.

Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe, and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures when they can.

For example, cave worms hatched in volcanic environments mature into crimson worms, while those raised near water sources mature into azure worms. Regardless of their environment, larval cave worms all have translucent bodies and pallid carapaces that harden and change color as they mature. When a brood of cave worms hatches from their eggs, the foot-long worms mass together, forming a swarm of ravenous larval worms. This swarm travels ceaselessly, consuming anything in its path. The young are drawn to movement, as living, squirming prey tends to be the most nutritious. As they age, they incorporate more minerals into their diet to support carapace growth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #195: Heavy is the Crown"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":14,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":100,"type":"tremorsense"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":21},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":19},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":12}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":22}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["animal","swarm"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.sky-kings-tomb-bestiary.Actor.pC2J4dh8hyuJSg1X"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"pgmACk7oSLLzcKFk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"HzOz51fQqR3fYL8l","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":18,"value":10},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"U1MgSOg8udyiVaSX","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.o6YCGx4lycsYpww4"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/haste.webp","name":"Haste","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>Magic empowers the target to act faster.

These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death.

Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction.

In these cases, the sporeborn mycelial network burrows through the corpse, replacing the original hyphae in fungal creatures and the xylem and pith in plants. This allows the sporeborn to puppet the creature, much as it does in mammals by replacing the tendons with its own rugged mycelium. Fungus and plant hosts are more likely to develop the potent poison sporeborn ability to enhance the hosts' natural abilities.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When a mindless guardian is needed, but the ethical bounds of creating undead are too uncouth, ritual casters may turn to a more fungal solution by creating a mycoguardian. Using valuable parasitic fungal spores, a ritualist may seed the corpse of a creature and encourage them to grow, sending mycelium tendrils throughout the body. The tendrils bond to mobile tissue such as bones, while replacing tendons with reinforced mycelium. This ritual magically replicates the yellow musk creepers' ability to spread throughout a dead organism then mobilize its body. But rather than a completely mindless fungal carrier, the ritualist has some control over the infested creature's behavior.</p>\n<p>The magic of the ritual includes basic instructions and rules that guide the new fungal mycoguardian (in this case, a sporeborn). Simple instructions like \"guard this room\" or \"slay all of the tiny creatures in this basement\" should work well enough, but complex commands such as \"deliver this letter to the Harbormaster of Caliphas\" are doomed to failure.</p>\n<h2>Fungel Ristualists</h2>\n<p>While mycoguardians are rare, several different types of primal spellcasters might create a mycoguardian. Druids might turn the bodies of a poacher's victim against the poacher, seeking to avenge the wrongful death and rebalance the scales of life. Leshy spellcasters create mycoguardians to protect their hidden communities and sacred groves. The fey of Northern Fangwood transform fallen or rotted trees into crustoreal mycoguardians, massive arboreal-looking creatures covered in parasitic lichen. These lumbering sentinels patrol their borders, crushing all non-fey who dare approach. There are rumors of crustoreals being imbued with void energy from the Gravelands and going berserk.</p>\n<h2>Creating Mycoguardians</h2>\n<p>To create a mycoguardian, such as a sporeborn, a ritualist can perform a ritual similar to create undead (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 411) called create mycoguardian, but providing valuable parasitic fungal spores instead of black onyx. This ritual uses Fungus Lore (trained) or Nature (expert) for both the Primary Check and Secondary Checks, and lacks the Evil trait.</p>\n<h2>Different Mycoguardians</h2>\n<p>In addition to the sporeborn presented here, there are many versions of the create mycoguardian ritual for making mycoguardians other than sporeborn, such as for aquatic chytridions and so on.

Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls the carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying flesh. Although an assassin vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.</p>\n<p>As it is slow moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area for as long as it has sufficient prey. Though most often found along woodland trails or swamps, these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements, poorly tended fields, and vineyards. While assassin vines can't be trained in the classical sense, they can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures like goblins and fey have been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians for less-used routes into their lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to make the path more obvious than its disuse would otherwise suggest, while simultaneously working to ensure the bones of the vines' victims are removed to keep their presence a secret, resulting in what appears to be an easy approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.</p>\n<p>Mature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller vines extending off the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10 feet in length. The smallest of these vines sprout every 6 inches or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and occasionally bear small berries.

and dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams. In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #195: Heavy is the Crown"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":14,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":15},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":18},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":14}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":14},"deception":{"base":18},"intimidation":{"base":18},"occultism":{"base":12},"stealth":{"base":18}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["dream","evil","incorporeal"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.sky-kings-tomb-bestiary.Actor.WDvKBcA5rQKzEwqH"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"WLrvwmPwZ21Upsvk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"HzOz51fQqR3fYL8l","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":18,"value":10},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"w12pCC2SaqlLxNgO","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.VosLNn2M8S7JH67D"},"img":"icons/skills/wounds/injury-eyes-blood-red.webp","name":"Blindness","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"fortitude"}},"description":{"value":"<p>You blind the target.

For example, cave worms hatched in volcanic environments mature into crimson worms, while those raised near water sources mature into azure worms. Regardless of their environment, larval cave worms all have translucent bodies and pallid carapaces that harden and change color as they mature. When a brood of cave worms hatches from their eggs, the foot-long worms mass together, forming a swarm of ravenous larval worms. This swarm travels ceaselessly, consuming anything in its path. The young are drawn to movement, as living, squirming prey tends to be the most nutritious. As they age, they incorporate more minerals into their diet to support carapace growth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #195: Heavy is the Crown"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":14,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":100,"type":"tremorsense"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":21},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":19},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":12}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":22}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["animal","swarm"]},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.sky-kings-tomb-bestiary.Actor.xkuTFMU6zN35gsae"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"xuKlDtvqQvbpGWt4","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"O01tkGK9bScQt2sk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Prepared Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"prepared"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slots":{"slot0":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"Fpdd2O2OQqWVMbdk"},{"id":"Wqhifh7yO6Nqjj2z"},{"id":"NHvFQDZ8BPQgzOVL"}]},"slot1":{"max":2,"prepared":[{"id":"DBZ2n13f8usweWlY"},{"id":"Qf4NDhttKQz2nVGP"}]}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":17,"value":0},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"_migration":{"version":0.933,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Fpdd2O2OQqWVMbdk","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.6.2","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.mAMEt4FFbdqoRnkN"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/chill-touch.webp","name":"Chill Touch","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{"0":{"applyMod":true,"category":null,"formula":"1d4","kinds":["damage"],"materials":[],"type":"void"}},"defense":{"save":{"basic":true,"statistic":"fortitude"}},"description":{"value":"<p>Siphoning void energy into yourself, your hand radiates a pale darkness.

For example, cave worms hatched in volcanic environments mature into crimson worms, while those raised near water sources mature into azure worms. Regardless of their environment, larval cave worms all have translucent bodies and pallid carapaces that harden and change color as they mature. When a brood of cave worms hatches from their eggs, the foot-long worms mass together, forming a swarm of ravenous larval worms. This swarm travels ceaselessly, consuming anything in its path. The young are drawn to movement, as living, squirming prey tends to be the most nutritious. As they age, they incorporate more minerals into their diet to support carapace growth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #195:
